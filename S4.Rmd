# S4

The S4 system is built on the same ideas of as S3 (generic functions), but provides a rigorous and strict implementation. There are three main differences between S3 and S4:

* S4 classes have formal definitions provided by a call to `setClass()`.
  An S4 class can have multiple parent classes.
  
* The fields of an S4 object don't use attributes or named elements, but 
  instead are called __slots__ and are accessed with the special `@` operator.
  
* Methods are not defined with a naming convention, but are instead
  defined by a call to `setMethod()`. S4 methods can dispatch on multiple
  arguments.
  
S4 is a rich system, and it's not possible to cover all of it in one chapter. Instead, we'll focus on what you need to know to read most S4 code, and write basic S4 components. Unfortunately there is not one good reference for S4 and as you move towards more advanced usage, you will need to piece together needed information by carefully reading the documentation and performing experiments. Some good places to start are:

* [S4 system development in Bioconductor][S4-bioconductor], a slide deck
  by Patrick Aboyoun.

* [S4 questions on stackoverflow][SO-Morgan] answered by Martin Morgan.

* [_Software for Data Analysis_][S4DA], a book by John Chambers.

All functions related to S4 live in the methods package. This package is always available when you're running R interactively, but may not be available when running R in batch mode (i.e. from `Rscript`). For this reason, it's a good idea to call `library(methods)` whenever you use S4. This also signals to the reader that you'll be using the S4 object system.

```{r setup}
library(methods)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Hide annoying output
setMethod <- function(...) invisible(methods::setMethod(...))
setGeneric <- function(...) invisible(methods::setGeneric(...))
```

## Classes

Unlike S3, S4 classes have a formal definition. To define an S4 class, you must define three key properties:

* The class __name__. By convention, S4 class names use UpperCamelCase.

* A named list that describes the names and classes of the __slots__ (fields).
  For example, a person might be represented by a character name and a numeric 
  age: `list(name = "character", age = "numeric")`. The pseudo-class "ANY" 
  allows a slot to accept objects of any type. \index{slots}

* The name of a class (or classes) to inherit behaviour from, or in S4 
  terminology, that classes that it __contains__. 

Slots and contains can specify the names of S4 classes, S3 classes (if registered), and base types. We'll go in to more detail about non-S4 classes at the end of the chapter, in [S4 and existing code].

To create a class, you call `setClass()`, supplying these three properties. Lets make this concrete with an example. Here we create two classes: a person with character `name` and numeric `age`, and an `Employee` that inherits slots and methods from `Person`, adding an additional `boss` slot that must be a `Person`.

```{r, cache = FALSE}
setClass("Person", 
  slots = list(
    name = "character", 
    age = "numeric"
  )
)
setClass("Employee", 
  contains = "Person", 
  slots = list(
    boss = "Person"
  )
)
```

`setClass()` has 10 other arguments, but they are all either deprecated or not recommended. If you have existing S4 code that uses them, I'd recommend carefully reading the documentation and upgrading to modern practice.

Once you have defined the class, you can create an object from that class by calling the collective constructor `new()`. The first argument gives the name of the class, and the remaining named arguments specify the values of the slots.

```{r}
hadley <- new("Person", name = "Hadley", age = 37)
hadley
```

In most programming languages, class definition occurs at compile-time, and object construction occurs later, run-time. In R, however, both definition and construction occur at run time. When you call `setClass()`, you are registering a class definition in a (hidden) global variable. As with all state-modifying functions you need to use `setClass()` with care. It's possible to create invalid objects if you redefine a class after already having instantiated an object:

```{r, error = TRUE}
setClass("A", slots = list(x = "numeric"))
a <- new("A", x = 10)

setClass("A", slots = list(a_different_slot = "numeric"))
a
```

This isn't usually a problem, because you'll define a class once, then leave the definition alone. If you want to enforce a single class definition, you can "seal" it:

```{r, error = TRUE}
setClass("Sealed", sealed = TRUE)
setClass("Sealed")
```

### Slots

To access the slots of an object, use `@` or `slot()`; `@` is equivalent to `$`, and `slot()` to `[[`. \index{subsetting!S4} \index{S4|subsetting}

```{r}
hadley@age
slot(hadley, "age")
```

You can list all available slots with `slotNames()`:

```{r}
slotNames(hadley)
```

(Internally, slots are implemented as attributes, so you can also use `attributes()` to get a glimpse of all the components at once. This isn't recommended, however, as it's an internal implementation detail and hence a bad idea to rely on it.)

As a user, you should generally not extract values out of someone elses object using `@`. The names of the slots are considered an implementation detail and may change without warning. Instead, look for a method that provides the information you want, and only access the slot directly if there's no other choice.

### Initializer

`new()` is a low-level constructor so you don't need to write one yourself like in S3. However, the default behaviour has two drawbacks:

*   If you don't supply values for the slots, `new()` will automatically 
    supply default values based on the class of the slot:

    ```{r}
    new("Person")
    ```
    
    Here, you might prefer that `name` is always required, or that `age` 
    defaults to `NA`.
    
*   It's not possible to create a S4 object with the wrong slots or 
    slots of the wrong type:

    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    new("Person", name = "Hadley", age = "thirty")
    new("Person", name = "Hadley", sex = "male")
    ```
    
    But it is possible to create slots with the wrong lengths:
    
    ```{r}
    new("Person", age = 1:10)
    ```

We can override the default behaviour by providing an `initialize()` method. You'll learn more about the details of creating methods in the next section, but in brief, the following code defines a `Person` method for the `intialize` generic.

```{r, cache = FALSE}
setMethod("initialize", "Person", function(.Object, name, age = NA_real_, ...) {
  stopifnot(length(name) == 1)
  stopifnot(length(age) == 1)
  
  .Object@name <- name
  .Object@age <- age
  
  callNextMethod(.Object, ...)
})
```

Your `intialize()` method should include named arguments for the slots whose default behaviour you want to modify. __You__ are then responsible for setting those values with `@`. You should also accept `...` and pass that on to `callNextMethod()`. This is a tecnhical requirement that allow future subclasses to make use of your initialize method.

```{r, error = TRUE}
# Name is now reqiured
new("Person")

# And must be length 1
new("Person", name = letters)

# And if not supplied, age gets a default value of NA
new("Person", name = "Hadley")
```

### Helper

As in S3, it's not necessary to provide a helper function, but you should, if needed. For example, imagine creating a S4 version of the factor class. Just like in the S3 case, you still want to supply a `Factor()` helper that takes a more natural specification of the inputs.

```{r}
setClass("Factor", 
  slots = list(levels = "character"),
  contains = "integer"
)

Factor <- function(x, levels = unique(x)) {
  ind <- match(x, levels)
  new("Factor", ind, levels = levels)
}
```

Note that this example uses another form of `new()`: unnnamed arguments are taken to be objects from the superclass, which in this case is the base integer type.

### Validator

It's possible to use the built-in `setValidity()` function to define a validator. I do not recommend using this feature because the validation method is always run by `new()`. This means that you no longer have a cheap way to create objects if you already know the values are valid.

Instead, follow the same principle as for S3: create a separate validate function that you can call when needed. Let's make this concrete by porting our S3 `validate_factor()` function to S4. 

```{r}
validateFactor <- function(x) {
  values <- x@.Data
  
  if (!all(!is.na(values) & values > 0)) {
    stop(
      "All `x` values must be non-missing and greater than zero",
      call. = FALSE
    )
  }
  
  if (length(x@levels) < max(values)) {
    stop(
      "There must at least as many `levels` as possible values in `x`",
      call. = FALSE
    )
  }
  
  x
}
```

There are two main differences: 

* We use camelCase instead of snake_case for the function name

* We use `@` instead of `attr()` to access the fields of the object. 

Note the use of the special `.Data` virtual slot: this only exists when you inherit from an S3 class or base type, and it allows you to get that underlying object.

### Introspection

To determine what classes an object inherits from, use `is()`:

```{r}
is(hadley)
```

To test if an object inherits from a specific class, use the second argument of `is()`:

```{r}
is(hadley, "person")
```

If you are using a class provided by a package you can get help on it with `class?Person`.

### Exercises

1.  What happens if you define a new S4 class that doesn't "contain" an 
    existing class?  (Hint: read about virtual classes in `?setClass`.)

1.  Imagine you were going to reimplement ordered factors, dates, and 
    data frames in S4. Sketch out the `setClass()` calls that you would
    use to define the classes.

## Generics and methods

The job of a generic is to perform method dispatch, i.e. find the method designed for the combination of classes passed to the generic. Here you'll learn how to define S4 generics and methods, then in the next section we'll explore precisely how S4 method dispatch works.

S4 generics have a similar structure to S3 generics, but a little more formal. To create an new S4 generic, you call `setGeneric()` with a function that calls `standardGeneric()`. \index{S4!generics} \index{S4!methods} \index{generics!S4} \index{methods!S4}.

```{r}
setGeneric("myGeneric", function(x) {
  standardGeneric("myGeneric")
})
```

(Like `setClass()`, `setGeneric()` has many other arguments, none of which you should ever need to use. Consult the documentation for details.)

A generic isn't useful without some methods, and in S4 you add methods with `setMethod()`. There are three important arguments: the name of the generic, the name of the class, and the method itself. (Again `setMethod()` has other arguments, but you should never use them.)

```{r}
setMethod("myGeneric", "Person", function(x) {
  # method implementation
})
```

### Show method

As with S3, the most commonly defined method controls how the object is printed. In S4, however, this method is called "show". When defining a method for an existing generic, you need first determine the arguments. You can you get those from the documentation or by looking at the formals of the generic. Unlike S3, if you get them wrong, `setMethod()` will tell you. Here we define a show method for Person, in order to improve the default output.

```{r}
setMethod("show", "Person", function(object) {
  cat("Person\n")
  cat("  Name: ", object@name, "\n", sep = "")
  cat("  Age:  ", object@age, "\n", sep = "")
})
hadley
```

More formally, the second argument to `setMethod()` is called the __signature__. In S4, unlike S3, the signature can include multiple arguments. This makes method dispatch substantially more complicated, but avoids having to implement double-dispatch as a special case. We'll talk more about multiple dispatch in the next section.

### Coercion



### Introspection

Use `.S4methods` to list all the methods that belong to a generic, or that are associated with a class.

```{r, cache = FALSE}
.S4methods("initialize")
.S4methods(class = "Person")
```

If you're looking for the implementation of specific method, you can use `selectMethod()`. You give it the name of the generic, and the class signature.

```{r}
selectMethod("show", "Person")
```

If you're using a method defined in a package, the easiest way to get help on it is to construct a valid call, and then put `?` in front it. `?` will use the arguments to figure out which help file you need:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?show(hadley)
```

### Exercises

1.  In the defintion of the generic, why is it necessary to repeat the
    name of the generic twice?
    
1.  What happens if you define a method with different argument names to
    the generic?

1.  What other ways can you find help for a method? Read `?"?"` and
    summarise the details.

## Method dispatch 

S4 dispatch is complicated because S4 has two important features:

* Multiple inheritance, i.e. a class can have multiple parents, 
* Multiple dispatch, i.e. a generic can use multiple arguments to pick a method. 

These features make S4 very powerful, but can also make it hard to understand which method will get selected for a given combination of inputs. 

To explain method dispatch, we'll start simple with single inheritance and single dispatch, and work out way up to the more complicated cases. To illustrate the ideas without getting bogged down in the details, we'll use an imaginary __class graph__ that uses emoji:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-emoji.png", dpi = 300)
```

Emoji give us very compact class names (just one symbol) that evoke the relationships between the classes. It should be straightfoward to remember that `r emo::ji("stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye")` inherits from `r emo::ji("wink")` which inherits from `r emo::ji("no_mouth")`, and that `r emo::ji("sunglasses")` inherits from both `r emo::ji("dark_sunglasses")` and `r emo::ji("slightly_smiling_face")`

### Single dispatch

Let's start with the simplest case: a generic function that dispatches on a single class with a single parent. The method dispatch here is quite simple, and the same as S3, but this will serve to define the graphical conventions we'll use for the more complex cases.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single.png", dpi = 300)
```

There are two parts to this diagram:

* The top part, `f(...)`, defines the scope of the diagram. Here we have a 
  generic with one argument, and we're going to explore method dispatch for a
  class heirarchy that is three levels deep. We'll only ever look at a small
  fragment of the complete class graph. This keeps individual diagrams simple
  while helping you build intutition that you apply to more complex class 
  graphs.
  
* The bottom part is the __method graph__ and  displays all possible methods 
  that could be defined. Methods that have been defined 
  (i.e. with `setMethod()`) have a grey background.

To find the method that gets called, you start with the class of the actual arguments, then follow the arrows until you find a method that exists. For example, if you called the function with an object of class `r emo::ji("wink")` you would follow the arrow right to find the method defined for the more general `r emo::ji("no_mouth")` class. If no method is found, method dispatch has failed and you get an error. For this reason, class graphs should usually have methods defined for all the terminal nodes, those on the far right. 

Note that the classes are arranged in a different order in the class graph and the method graph. in different orders in the generic call vs. the method list. This is because you understand a class hierarchy by moving from the generic to the specific, but method dispatch proceeds in the opposite direction, from the the most specific to the most general.

There are two pseudo-classes that you can define methods for. These are called pseudo-classes because don't actually exist, but allow you define useful behaviours. The first pseudo-class is "ANY". This matches any class, and plays the same role as the `default` pseudo-class in S3. For technical reasons that we'll get to later, the link to the "ANY" method is longer than the links between the other classes:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single-any.png", dpi = 300)
```

The second pseudo-class is "MISSING". If you define a method for this "class", it will match whenever the argument is missing. It's generally not useful for functions that take a single argument, but can be used for functions like `+` and `-` that behave differently depending on whether they have one or two arguments.

### Multiple inheritance

Things get more complicated when the class has multiple parents.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple.png", dpi = 300)
```

The basic process remains the same: you start from the actual class supplied to the generic, then follow the arrows until you find a defined method. The wrinkle is now that there are multiple arrows to follow, so you might find multiple methods. If that happens, you pick the method that is closest, i.e. requires travelling the fewest arrows. 

(The method graph is a powerful metaphor that helps you understand how method dispatch works. However, implementing method dispatch in this way would be rather inefficient so the actual approach that S4 uses is somewhat different. You can read the details in `?Methods_Details`)

What happens if methods are the same distance? For example, imagine we've defined methods for `r emo::ji("dark_sunglasses")` and `r emo::ji("slightly_smiling_face")`, and we call the generic with `r emo::ji("sunglasses")`:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple-ambig.png", dpi = 300)
```

This is called an __ambiguous__ method, and in diagrams I'll illustrate it with a thick dotted border. When this happens in R, you'll get a warning, and one of the two methods is basically picked at random (it uses the method that comes first in the alphabet). When you discover ambiguity you should always resolve it by providing a more precise method:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple-ambig-2.png", dpi = 300)
```

The fallback "ANY" method still exists but the rules are little more complex. As indicated by the wavy dotted lines, the "ANY" method is always considered further away than method for a real class. This means that it will never contribute to ambiguity.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple-any.png", dpi = 300)
```

It is hard to simultaneously prevent ambiguity, ensure that every terminal method has an implementation, and minimise the number of defined methods (in order to benefit from OOP). For example, of the six ways to define only two methods for this call, only one is free from problems. For this reason, I recommend using multiple inheritance with extreme care: you will need to carefully think about the method graph and plan accordingly.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple-all.png", dpi = 300)
```

### Multiple dispatch

Once you understand multiple inheritance, understanding multiple dispatch is straightforward. You follow multiple arrows in the same way as previously, but now each method is specified by two classes (separated by a comma).

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single-single.png", dpi = 300)
```

I'm not going to show examples of dispatching on more than two arguments, but you can follow the basic principles to generate your own method graphs.

The main difference between multiple inheritance and multiple dispatch is that there are many more arrows to follow. The following diagram shows four defined methods produce two ambiguous cases:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single-single-ambig.png", dpi = 300)
```

Multiple dispatch tends to be less tricky to work with than multiple inheritance because are usually fewer terminal class combinations. In this example, there's only one. That means, at a minimum, you can define a single method and have default behaviour for all inputs.

### Multiple dispatch and multiple inheritance

Of course you can combine multiple dispatch with multiple inheritance:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-single-multiple.png", dpi = 300)
```

A still more complicated case dispatches on two classes both of which have mulitple inheritance:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4-multiple-multiple.png", dpi = 300)
```

However, as the method graph gets more and more complicated it gets harder and harder to predict which actual method will get called given a combination of inputs, and it gets harder and harder to make sure that you haven't introduced ambiguity. I highly recommend avoiding the combination of the two. There are some techniques (like mixins) that allow you to tame this complexity, but I am not aware of a detailed treatment as applied to S4.

### Exercises

1.  Take the last example which shows multiple dispatch over two classes that
    use multiple inheritance. What happens if you define a method for all
    terminal classes? Why does method dispatch not save us much work here?

## S4 and existing code

Even when writing new S4 code, you'll still need to interact with existing S3 classes and functions, including existing S3 generics. This section describes how S4 classes, methods, and generics interacts with existing code.

### Classes

In `slots` and `contains` you can use S4 classes, S3 classes, or the implicit class of a base type.  To use an S3 class, you must first register it with `setOldClass()`. You call this function once for each S3 class, giving it the class attribute. For example, the following defintions are already provided by base R:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setOldClass("data.frame")
setOldClass(c("ordered", "factor"))
setOldClass(c("glm", "lm"))
```

Generally, these definitions should be provided by the creator of the S3 class. If you're trying to build an S4 class on top of a S3 class provided by a package, it is better to request that the package maintainer to add this call to the package, rather than running it yourself. 

If an S4 object inherits from an S3 class or a base type, it will have a special virtual slot called `.Data`. This contains the underlying base type or S3 object: \indexc{.Data}

```{r}
RangedNumeric <- setClass(
  "RangedNumeric",
  contains = "numeric",
  slots = list(min = "numeric", max = "numeric")
)
rn <- RangedNumeric(1:10, min = 1, max = 10)
rn@min
rn@.Data
```

It is possible to define S3 methods for S4 generics, and S4 methods for S3 generics (provided you've called `setOldClass()`). However, it's more complicated that it might appear at first glance, so make sure you thoroughly read `?Methods_for_S3`.

### Generics

As well as creating a new generic from scratch (as shown in [generics and methods]), it's also possible to convert an existing function to a generic. 

```{r}
sides <- function(object) 0
setGeneric("sides")
```

In this case, the existing function becomes the default ("ANY") method:
 
```{r}
selectMethod("sides", "ANY")
```
 
Note that `setMethod()` will automatically call `setGeneric()` if the first argument isn't already a generic, enabling you to turn any existing function into an S4 generic. I think it is ok to convert an existing S3 generic to S4, but you should avoid converting regular functions because it makes code harder to use (and requires coordination if done by multiple packages).
