## Introduction

S4 provides a formal approach to functional OOP. The underlying ideas are similar to S3 (the topic of Chapter \@ref(s3)), but implementation is much stricter and makes use of specialised functions for creating classes (`setClass()`), generics (`setGeneric()`), and methods (`setMethod()`). Additionally, S4 provides both multiple inheritance (i.e. a class can have multiple parents) and multiple dispatch (i.e. method dispatch can use the class of multiple arguments).

An important new component in S4 the __slot__, a named component of the object that is accessed using the specialised subsetting operator `@` (pronounced at). The set of slots, and their classes, forms an important part of the definition of an S4 class.

Like the other OO chapters, the focus here will be on S4 works, not how to deploy it most effectively. 

### Learning more {-}

There are two main challenges when learning S4:

* There is no one single S4 reference that will answer all your questions.

* The built-in documentation sometimes clashes with community best practices.

As you move towards more advanced usage, you will need to piece together needed information by carefully reading the documentation, asking questions on StackOverflow, and performing experiments. Some good places to start are:

*   The Bioconductor community is a long-term user and have produced much of
    best material about effect use of S4. Start with [S4 classes and
    methods][bioc-s4-class] (2017) taught by Martin Morgan and Hervé Pagès, 
    checking for newer editions at [Bioconductor course materials][bioc-courses].
  
    Martin Morgan, an R-core and Bioconductor-core developer, and a world 
    expert in practical use of S4. I strongly recommend reading the questions
    about S4 that he has answered on [stackoverflow][SO-Morgan].

*   John Chambers is the author of the S4 system, and provides an overview      
    of its motivation and historical context in "Object-oriented programming,
    functional programming and R" [@chambers-2014]. For a fuller exploration
    of S4, see his book "Software for Data Analysis" [@s4da].

### Outline {-}

* Section \@ref(s4-basics) gives a rapid tour of the main components of S4:
  classes, generics, and methods.
  
* Section \@ref(s4-classes) dives into the details of S4 classes. You'll
  learn about the important helper function that should accompany most
  S4 classes, and how to set up a validator where needed.
  
* Section \@ref(s4-generics) shows you how to create new S4 generics, and 
  how to supply those generics with methods. You'll also learn about
  accessor functions which are designed to allow users to safely get and set
  object slots.
  
* Section \@ref(s4-dispatch) dives into the full details of method dispatch
  in S4. This gets quite complicated with the combination of multiple 
  inheritance and multiple dispatch.
  
* Section \@ref(s4-s3) discusses the interaction between S4 and S3, showing
  you how to use them together.

### Prerequisites {-}

All functions related to S4 live in the methods package. This package is always available when you're running R interactively, but may not be available when running R in batch mode (i.e. from `Rrcript`). For this reason, it's a good idea to call `library(methods)` whenever you use S4. This also signals to the reader that you'll be using the S4 object system.

```{r}
library(methods)
```

## Basics {#s4-basics}

We'll start with a quick overview of the main components of S4 and then dive into the details below. You define a S4 class by calling `setClass()` with the class name and a definition of its slots, the names and classes of the class data.

```{r}
setClass("Person", 
  slots = c(
    name = "character", 
    age = "numeric"
  )
)
```

Can construct new objects from a class by calling `new()` and providing values for the slots:

```{r}
john <- new("Person", name = "John Smith", age = NA_real_)
```

Access the slot values with `@` (equivalent to `$`) or `slot()` (equivalent to `[[`):

```{r}
john@name
slot(john, "age")
```

Generally, you should only use `@` in methods. If you're working for with someone elses class, look for __accessor__ functions that allow you to safely set and get slot values. As the developer of a class, you should also provide your own accessor functions. Accessors are typically S4 generics allowing multiple classes to have the same external interface.

Here we'll create a set and getter for the `age` slot by firsting creating generics with `setGeneric()`:

```{r}
setGeneric("age", function(x) standardGeneric("age"))
setGeneric("age<-", function(x, value) standardGeneric("age<-"))
```

And then defining methods with `setMethod()`:

```{r}
setMethod("age", "Person", function(x) x@age)
setMethod("age<-", "Person", function(x, value) {
  stop("`@age` is readonly", call. = FALSE)
})
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
age(john)
age(john) <- 50
```

If you're using an S4 class defined in a package, you can get help on it with `class?Person`. To get help for a method, put `?` in front of a call: `?age(john)`. `?` will use the class of the arguments to figure out which help file you need.

Use sloop functions to identify S4 objects and generics found in the wild:

```{r}
sloop::otype(john)
sloop::ftype(age)
```

### Exercises

1.  `lubridate::period()` returns an S4 class. What slots does it have?
    What class is each slot? What accessors does it provide?

1.  What other ways can you find help for a method? Read `?"?"` and
    summarise the details.

## Classes {#s4-classes}
\index{setClass()}

To define an S4 class, call `setClass()` with three arguments:

* The class __name__. By convention, S4 class names use UpperCamelCase.

* A named character vector that describes the names and classes of the 
  __slots__ (fields). For example, a person might be represented by a character 
  name and a numeric  age: `c(name = "character", age = "numeric")`. The 
  pseudo-class "ANY" allows a slot to accept objects of any type.

* A __prototype__, a list of default values for each slot. Technically,
  the prototype is optional[^prototype-docs], but it's strongly recommended as 
  it makes use of the class much easier.

[prototype-docs]: Note that `?setClass` recommends that you avoid the the `prototype` argument, but this is generally considered to be bad advice.

The code below illustrates the three arguments by creating a `Person` class with character `name` and numeric `age` slots.

```{r, cache = FALSE}
setClass("Person", 
  slots = c(
    name = "character", 
    age = "numeric"
  ), 
  prototype = list(
    name = NA_character_,
    age = NA_real_
  )
)

me <- new("Person", name = "Hadley")
me
```

### Inheritance

There is one other important argument to `setClass()`: `contains`. This defines a class (or classes) to inherit behaviour from. For example, we can create an `Employee` class that inherits slots and behaviour from the `Person` class, but additionally contains a slot that desribes their boss.

```{r}
setClass("Employee", 
  contains = "Person", 
  slots = c(
    boss = "Person"
  ),
  prototype = list(
    boss = new("Person")
  )
)

new("Employee")
```

`setClass()` has 9 other arguments but they are either deprecated or not recommended. If you have existing S4 code that uses them, I'd recommend carefully reading the documentation and upgrading to modern practice. 

### Redefinition

In most programming languages, class definition occurs at compile-time and object construction occurs later, at run-time. In R, however, both definition and construction occur at run time. When you call `setClass()`, you are registering a class definition in a (hidden) global variable. As with all state-modifying functions you need to use `setClass()` with care. It's possible to create invalid objects if you redefine a class after already having instantiated an object:

```{r, error = TRUE}
setClass("A", slots = c(x = "numeric"))
a <- new("A", x = 10)

setClass("A", slots = c(a_different_slot = "numeric"))
a
```

This can cause confusion during interactive creation of new classes.

### Helper

`new()` is a low-level constructor suitable for use by you, the developer. User-facing classes should always be paired with a user-friendly helper. A helper should always:

* Have the same name as the class, e.g. `myclass()`.

* Have a thoughtfully crafted user interface with carefully chosen default
  values and useful conversions.

* Create carefully crafted error messages tailored towards an end-user.

* Finish by calling by calling `methods::new()`

The `Person` class is so simple so a helper is almost superfluous, but we can use it to clearly define the contract: `age` is optional but `name` is required.

```{r}
Person <- function(name, age = NA) {
  age <- as.double(age)
  
  new("Person", name = name, age = age)
}

Person("Hadley")
```

### Validator

The constructor automatically checks that the slots have correct classes:

```{r, error = TRUE}
Person(mtcars)
```

But you will need to implement more complicated checks (i.e. checks that involve lengths, or multiple slots) yourself. For example, we might want to make it clear that the Person class is a vector class, and can store data about multiple people. That's not currently clear because `@name` and `@age` can be different lengths:

```{r}
Person("Hadley", age = c(30, 37))
```

To enforce these additional constraints we write a validator with `setValidity()`. It takes class and a function that returns `TRUE` if the input is valid, and otherwise returns a character vector describing the problem(s):

```{r}
setValidity("Person", function(object) {
  if (length(object@name) != length(object@age)) {
    "@name and @age must be same length"
  } else {
    TRUE
  }
})
```

Now we can no longer create an invalid object:

```{r, error = TRUE}
Person("Hadley", age = c(30, 37))
```

Note that the validity method is only called automatically by `new()`, so you can still create an invalid object by modifying it:

```{r}
john <- Person("John", age = 30)
john@age <- 1:10
```

You can explicitly check the validity yourself by calling `validObject()`:

```{r, error = TRUE}
validObject(john)
```

In Section \@ref(accessors), we'll use `validObject()` to create accessor functions that always return valid objects.

### Introspection

To determine what classes an object inherits from, use `is()`:

```{r}
is(john)
```

To test if an object inherits from a specific class, use the second argument of `is()`:

```{r}
is(john, "person")
```

### Exercises

1.  Extend the Person class with fields to match `utils::person()`.
    Think about what slots you will need, and what you'll need to check in
    your validity method.

1.  What happens if you define a new S4 class that doesn't have any slots?
    (Hint: read about virtual classes in `?setClass`.)

1.  Imagine you were going to reimplement factors, dates, and, data frames in 
    S4. Sketch out the `setClass()` calls that you would use to define the 
    classes. Think about appropriate `slots` and `prototype`.

## Generics and methods {#s4-generics}
\index{S4!generics} 
\index{S4!methods} 
\index{generics!S4} 
\index{methods!S4}
\indexc{setGeneric()}
\indexc{standardGeneric()}

The job of a generic is to perform method dispatch, i.e. find the method designed to handle the combination of classes passed to the generic. Here you'll learn how to define S4 generics and methods, then in the next section we'll explore precisely how S4 method dispatch works.

S4 generics have a similar structure to S3 generics, but are a little more formal. To create a new S4 generic, you call `setGeneric()` with a function that calls `standardGeneric()`. 

```{r}
setGeneric("myGeneric", function(x) standardGeneric("myGeneric"))
```

It is bad practice to use `{}` in the generic as it triggers a special case that is more expensive, and generally best avoided.

```{r}
# Don't do this!
setGeneric("myGeneric", function(x) {
  standardGeneric("myGeneric")
})
```

### Signature

Like `setClass()`, `setGeneric()` has many other arguments. There is only one that you need to know about: `signature`. This allows you to control the arguments that are used for method dispatch. If `signature` is not supplied, all arguments (apart from `...`) are used. It is occassionally useful to remove arguments from dispatch. This allows you to require that methods provide arguments like `verbose = TRUE` or `quiet = FALSE`, but they don't take part in dispatch.

```{r}
setGeneric("myGeneric", 
  function(x, ..., verbose = TRUE) standardGeneric("myGeneric"),
  signature = "x"
)
```

### Methods
\indexc{setMethod()}

A generic isn't useful without some methods, and in S4 you add methods with `setMethod()`. There are three important arguments: the name of the generic, the name of the class, and the method itself. 

```{r}
setMethod("myGeneric", "Person", function(x) {
  # method implementation
})
```

More formally, the second argument to `setMethod()` is called the __signature__. In S4, unlike S3, the signature can include multiple arguments. This makes method dispatch in S4 substantially more complicated, but avoids having to implement double-dispatch as a special case. We'll talk more about multiple dispatch in the next section.

`setMethod()` has other arguments, but you should never use them, just like `setClass()` and `setGeneric()`.

### Show method

As with S3, the most commonly defined S4 method controls printing, but in S4 we use a different generic: `show()`. When defining a method for an existing generic, you need to first determine the arguments. You can get those from the documentation or by looking at the `args()` of the generic:

```{r}
args(getGeneric("show"))
```

Our show method needs to have a single argument `object`:

```{r}
setMethod("show", "Person", function(object) {
  cat(is(object)[[1]], "\n",
      "  Name: ", object@name, "\n",
      "  Age:  ", object@age, "\n",
      sep = ""
  )
})
john
```

### Accessors

Slots are generally considered to be an internal implementation detail: they can change without warning and user code should avoid accessing them directly. Instead, all user-accessible slots should get an __accessor__. If the slot is unique to the class, this can just be a function:

```{r}
person_name <- function(x) x@name
```

Typically, however, you'll define a generic so that multiple classes can use the same interface:

```{r}
setGeneric("name", function(x) standardGeneric("name"))
setMethod("name", "Person", function(x) x@name)

name(john)
```

If the slot is also writeable, you should provide a setter function. This will be slightly more complicated than the getter because you should always call `validObject()` to check that the new object is still valid.

```{r, error = TRUE}
setGeneric("name<-", function(x, value) standardGeneric("name<-"))
setMethod("name<-", "Person", function(x, value) {
  x@name <- value
  validObject(x)
  x
})
  
name(hadley) <- "Johnathan Smythe"
name(hadley)
```

(If the `name<-` notation is unfamiliar, check out Section \@ref(function-forms).)

### Introspection

To list all the methods that belong to a generic, or that are associated with a class, use `.S4methods()`:

```{r}
.S4methods("initialize")
.S4methods(class = "Person")
```

If you're looking for the implementation of a specific method, you can use `selectMethod()`. You give it the name of the generic and the class (or classes) that it's called with:

```{r}
selectMethod("show", "Person")
```

### Exercises

1.  Add `age()` accessors for the `Person` class.

1.  In the definition of the generic, why is it necessary to repeat the
    name of the generic twice?
 
1.  What's the difference between the generics generated by these two calls?
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    setGeneric("myGeneric", function(x) standardGeneric("myGeneric"))
    setGeneric("myGeneric", function(x) {
      standardGeneric("myGeneric")
    })
    ```
   
1.  What happens if you define a method with different argument names to
    the generic?


## Method dispatch {#s4-dispatch}

S4 dispatch is complicated because S4 has two important features:

* Multiple inheritance, i.e. a class can have multiple parents, 
* Multiple dispatch, i.e. a generic can use multiple arguments to pick a method. 

These features make S4 very powerful, but can also make it hard to understand which method will get selected for a given combination of inputs. In practice, you should keep method dispatch as simple as possible by avoiding multiple inheritance, and reserving multiple dispatch for only where it is absolutely necessary.

But it's important to describe the full details, so here we'll start simple with single inheritance and single dispatch, and work our way up to the more complicated cases. To illustrate the ideas without getting bogged down in the details, we'll use an imaginary __class graph__ based on emoji:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4/emoji.png")
```

Emoji give us very compact class names that evoke the relationships between the classes. It should be straightforward to remember that `r emoji("stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye")` inherits from `r emoji("wink")` which inherits from `r emoji("no_mouth")`, and that `r emoji("sunglasses")` inherits from both `r emoji("dark_sunglasses")` and `r emoji("slightly_smiling_face")`.

### Single dispatch

Let's start with the simplest case: a generic function that dispatches on a single class with a single parent. The method dispatch here is simple so it's a good place to define the graphical conventions we'll use for the more complex cases.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4/single.png")
```

There are two parts to this diagram:

* The top part, `f(...)`, defines the scope of the diagram. Here we have a 
  generic with one argument, that has a class hierarchy that is three levels 
  deep.
  
* The bottom part is the __method graph__ and  displays all the possible methods 
  that could be defined. Methods that have been defined 
  (i.e. with `setMethod()`) have a grey background. 

To find the method that gets called, you start with the class of the actual arguments, then follow the arrows until you find a method that exists. For example, if you called the function with an object of class `r emoji("wink")` you would follow the arrow right to find the method defined for the more general `r emoji("no_mouth")` class. If no method is found, method dispatch has failed and you get an error. In practice this means that you should alway define methods defined for the terminal nodes, i.e. those on the far right. 

There are two __pseudo-classes__ that you can define methods for. These are called pseudo-classes because they don't actually exist, but allow you to define useful behaviours. The first pseudo-class is "ANY". This matches any class, and plays the same role as the `default` pseudo-class in S3. For technical reasons that we'll get to later, the link to the "ANY" method is longer than the links between the other classes:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4/single-any.png")
```

The second pseudo-class is "MISSING". If you define a method for this "class", it will match whenever the argument is missing. It'snot useful for single dispatch, but is important for functions like `+` and `-` that use double dispatch and behave differently depending on whether they have one or two arguments.

### Multiple inheritance

Things get more complicated when the class has multiple parents.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4/multiple.png")
```

The basic process remains the same: you start from the actual class supplied to the generic, then follow the arrows until you find a defined method. The wrinkle is that now there are multiple arrows to follow, so you might find multiple methods. If that happens, you pick the method that is closest, i.e. requires travelling the fewest arrows. 

(The method graph is a powerful metaphor that helps you understand how method dispatch works. However, implementing method dispatch in this way would be rather inefficient so the actual approach that S4 uses is somewhat different. You can read the details in `?Methods_Details`)

What happens if methods are the same distance? For example, imagine we've defined methods for `r emoji("dark_sunglasses")` and `r emoji("slightly_smiling_face")`, and we call the generic with `r emoji("sunglasses")`. Note that there's no implementation for the `r emoji("no_mouth")` class, as indicated by the red double outline.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4/multiple-ambig.png")
```

This is called an __ambiguous__ method, and in diagrams I'll illustrate it with a thick dotted border. When this happens in R, you'll get a warning, and one of the two methods is basically picked at random (it uses the method that comes first in the alphabet). When you discover ambiguity you should always resolve it by providing a more precise method:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4/multiple-ambig-2.png")
```

The fallback "ANY" method still exists but the rules are little more complex. As indicated by the wavy dotted lines, the "ANY" method is always considered further away than a method for a real class. This means that it will never contribute to ambiguity.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4/multiple-any.png")
```

It is hard to simultaneously prevent ambiguity, ensure that every terminal method has an implementation, and minimise the number of defined methods (in order to benefit from OOP). For example, of the six ways to define only two methods for this call, only one is free from problems. For this reason, I recommend using multiple inheritance with extreme care: you will need to carefully think about the method graph and plan accordingly.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4/multiple-all.png")
```

### Multiple dispatch

Once you understand multiple inheritance, understanding multiple dispatch is straightforward. You follow multiple arrows in the same way as previously, but now each method is specified by two classes (separated by a comma).

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4/single-single.png")
```

I'm not going to show examples of dispatching on more than two arguments, but you can follow the basic principles to generate your own method graphs.

The main difference between multiple inheritance and multiple dispatch is that there are many more arrows to follow. The following diagram shows four defined methods which produce two ambiguous cases:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4/single-single-ambig.png")
```

Multiple dispatch tends to be less tricky to work with than multiple inheritance because there are usually fewer terminal class combinations. In this example, there's only one. That means, at a minimum, you can define a single method and have default behaviour for all inputs.

### Multiple dispatch and multiple inheritance

Of course you can combine multiple dispatch with multiple inheritance:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4/single-multiple.png")
```

A still more complicated case dispatches on two classes, both of which have multiple inheritance:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/s4/multiple-multiple.png")
```

However, as the method graph gets more and more complicated it gets harder and harder to predict which actual method will get called given a combination of inputs, and it gets harder and harder to make sure that you haven't introduced ambiguity. If you have to draw diagrams to figure out what method is actually going to be called, it's a strong sign you  should go back simplify your design.

### Exercises

1.  Draw the method graph for 
    `r code("f(", emoji("sweat_smile"), ", ", emoji("kissing_cat"), ")")`

1.  Draw the method graph for 
    `r code("f(", emoji("smiley"), ", ", emoji("wink"), ", ", emoji("kissing_smiling_eyes"), ")")`

1.  Take the last example which shows multiple dispatch over two classes that
    use multiple inheritance. What happens if you define a method for all
    terminal classes? Why does method dispatch not save us much work here?

## S4 and S3 {#s4-s3}

Even when writing new S4 code, you'll still need to interact with existing S3 classes and functions, including existing S3 generics. This section describes how S4 classes, methods, and generics interact with existing code.

### Classes

In `slots` and `contains` you can use S4 classes, S3 classes, or the implicit class of a base type.  To use an S3 class, you must first register it with `setOldClass()`. You call this function once for each S3 class, giving it the class attribute. For example, the following definitions are already provided by base R:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setOldClass("data.frame")
setOldClass(c("ordered", "factor"))
setOldClass(c("glm", "lm"))
```

However, it's generally better to be a little more specific and provide a full S4 definition with `slots` and a `prototype`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setClass("factor",
  contains = "integer",
  slots = c(
    levels = "character"
  ),
  prototype = structure(
    integer(),
    levels = character()
  )
)
setOldClass("factor", S4Class = "factor")
```

Generally, these definitions should be provided by the creator of the S3 class. If you're trying to build an S4 class on top of an S3 class provided by a package, it is better to request that the package maintainer add this call to the package, rather than running it yourself. 

If an S4 object inherits from an S3 class or a base type, it will have a special virtual slot called `.Data`. This contains the underlying base type or S3 object: \indexc{.Data}

```{r}
RangedNumeric <- setClass(
  "RangedNumeric",
  contains = "numeric",
  slots = c(min = "numeric", max = "numeric"),
  prototype = structure(numeric(), min = NA_real_, max = NA_real_)
)
rn <- RangedNumeric(1:10, min = 1, max = 10)
rn@min
rn@.Data
```

It is possible to define S3 methods for S4 generics, and S4 methods for S3 generics (provided you've called `setOldClass()`). However, it's more complicated than it might appear at first glance, so make sure you thoroughly read `?Methods_for_S3`.

### Generics

As well as creating a new generic from scratch, it's also possible to convert an existing S3 generic to an S4 generic:

```{r}
setGeneric("mean")
```

In this case, the existing function becomes the default ("ANY") method:
 
```{r}
selectMethod("mean", "ANY")
```
 
Note that `setMethod()` will automatically call `setGeneric()` if the first argument isn't already a generic, enabling you to turn any existing function into an S4 generic. It is ok to convert an existing S3 generic to S4, but you should avoid converting regular functions to S4 generics because it makes code harder to use and requires carefuk coordination if done by multiple packages.

### Exercises

1.  What would a full `setOldClass()` definition look like for an ordered 
    factor? (i.e. add `slots` and `prototype` the definition above)

1.  Define a `length` method for the `Person` class.
