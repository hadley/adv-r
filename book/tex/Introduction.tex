\chapter{Introduction}

With more than 10 years experience programming in R, I've had the luxury
of being able to spend a lot of time trying to figure out and understand
how the language works. This book is my attempt to pass on what I've
learned so that you can quickly become an effective R programmer.
Reading it will help you avoid the mistakes I've made and dead ends I've
gone down, and will teach you useful tools, techniques, and idioms that
can help you to attack many types of problems. In the process, I hope to
show that, despite its frustrating quirks, R is, at its heart, an
elegant and beautiful language, well tailored for data analysis and
statistics.

If you are new to R, you might wonder what makes learning such a quirky
language worthwhile. To me, some of the best features are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  It's free, open source, and available on every major platform. As a
  result, if you do your analysis in R, anyone can easily replicate it.
\item
  A massive set of packages for statistical modelling, machine learning,
  visualisation, and importing and manipulating data. Whatever model or
  graphic you're trying to do, chances are that someone has already
  tried to do it. At a minimum, you can learn from their efforts.
\item
  Cutting edge tools. Researchers in statistics and machine learning
  will often publish an R package to accompany their articles. This
  means immediate access to the very latest statistical techniques and
  implementations.
\item
  Deep-seated language support for data analysis. This includes features
  likes missing values, data frames, and subsetting.
\item
  A fantastic community. It is easy to get help from experts on the
  \href{https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help}{R-help mailing
  list},
  \href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r}{stackoverflow}, or
  subject-specific mailing lists like
  \href{https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-sig-mixed-models}{R-SIG-mixed-models}
  or \href{https://groups.google.com/forum/\#!forum/ggplot2}{ggplot2}.
  You can also connect with other R learners via
  \href{https://twitter.com/search?q=\%23rstats}{twitter},
  \href{http://www.linkedin.com/groups/R-Project-Statistical-Computing-77616}{linkedin},
  and through many local
  \href{http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/local-r-groups.html}{user
  groups}.
\item
  Powerful tools for communicating your results. R packages make it easy
  to produce html or pdf \href{http://yihui.name/knitr/}{reports}, or
  create \href{http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/}{interactive websites}.
\item
  A strong foundation in functional programming. The ideas of functional
  programming are well suited to solving many of the challenges of data
  analysis. R provides a powerful and flexible toolkit which allows you
  to write concise yet descriptive code.
\item
  An \href{http://www.rstudio.com/ide/}{IDE} tailored to the needs of
  interactive data analysis and statistical programming.
\item
  Powerful metaprogramming facilities. R is not just a programming
  language, it is also an environment for interactive data analysis. Its
  metaprogramming capabilities allow you to write magically succinct and
  concise functions and provide an excellent environment for designing
  domain-specific languages.
\item
  Designed to connect to high-performance programming languages like C,
  Fortran, and C++.
\end{itemize}

Of course, R is not perfect. R's biggest challenge is that most R users
are not programmers. This means that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Much of the R code you'll see in the wild is written in haste to solve
  a pressing problem. As a result, code is not very elegant, fast, or
  easy to understand. Most users do not revise their code to address
  these shortcomings.
\item
  Compared to other programming languages, the R community tends to be
  more focussed on results instead of processes. Knowledge of software
  engineering best practices is patchy: for instance, not enough R
  programmers use source code control or automated testing.
\item
  Metaprogramming is a double-edged sword. Too many R functions use
  tricks to reduce the amount of typing at the cost of making code that
  is hard to understand and that can fail in unexpected ways.
\item
  Inconsistency is rife across contributed packages, even within base R.
  You are confronted with over 20 years of evolution every time you use
  R. Learning R can be tough because there are many special cases to
  remember.
\item
  R is not a particularly fast programming language, and poorly written
  R code can be terribly slow. R is also a profligate user of memory.
\end{itemize}

Personally, I think these challenges create a great opportunity for
experienced programmers to have a profound positive impact on R and the
R community. R users do care about writing high quality code,
particularly for reproducible research, but they don't yet have the
skills to do so. I hope this book will not only help more R users to
become R programmers but also encourage programmers from other languages
to contribute to R.

\section{Who should read this book}\label{who-should-read}

This book is aimed at two complementary audiences:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Intermediate R programmers who want to dive deeper into R and learn
  new strategies for solving diverse problems.
\item
  Programmers from other languages who are learning R and want to
  understand why R works the way it does.
\end{itemize}

To get the most out of this book, you'll need to have written a decent
amount of code in R or another programming language. You might not know
all the details, but you should be familiar with how functions work in R
and although you may currently struggle to use them effectively, you
should be familiar with the apply family (like \texttt{apply()} and
\texttt{lapply()}).

\section{What you will get out of this book}\label{what-you-will-get}

This book describes the skills I think an advanced R programmer should
have: the ability to produce quality code that can be used in a wide
variety of circumstances.

After reading this book, you will:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Be familiar with the fundamentals of R. You will understand complex
  data types and the best ways to perform operations on them. You will
  have a deep understanding of how functions work, and be able to
  recognise and use the four object systems in R.
\item
  Understand what functional programming means, and why it is a useful
  tool for data analysis. You'll be able to quickly learn how to use
  existing tools, and have the knowledge to create your own functional
  tools when needed.
\item
  Appreciate the double-edged sword of metaprogramming. You'll be able
  to create functions that use non-standard evaluation in a principled
  way, saving typing and creating elegant code to express important
  operations. You'll also understand the dangers of metaprogramming and
  why you should be careful about its use.
\item
  Have a good intuition for which operations in R are slow or use a lot
  of memory. You'll know how to use profiling to pinpoint performance
  bottlenecks, and you'll know enough C++ to convert slow R functions to
  fast C++ equivalents.
\item
  Be comfortable reading and understanding the majority of R code.
  You'll recognise common idioms (even if you wouldn't use them
  yourself) and be able to critique others' code.
\end{itemize}

\section{Meta-techniques}\label{meta-techniques}

There are two meta-techniques that are tremendously helpful for
improving your skills as an R programmer: reading source code and
adopting a scientific mindset.

Reading source code is important because it will help you write better
code. A great place to start developing this skill is to look at the
source code of the functions and packages you use most often. You'll
find things that are worth emulating in your own code and you'll develop
a sense of taste for what makes good R code. You will also see things
that you don't like, either because its virtues are not obvious or it
offends your sensibilities. Such code is nonetheless valuable, because
it helps make concrete your opinions on good and bad code.

A scientific mindset is extremely helpful when learning R. If you don't
understand how something works, develop a hypothesis, design some
experiments, run them, and record the results. This exercise is
extremely useful since if you can't figure something out and need to get
help, you can easily show others what you tried. Also, when you learn
the right answer, you'll be mentally prepared to update your world view.
When I clearly describe a problem to someone else (the art of creating a
\href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269}{reproducible
example}), I often figure out the solution myself.

\section{Recommended reading}\label{recommended-reading}

R is still a relatively young language, and the resources to help you
understand it are still maturing. In my personal journey to understand
R, I've found it particularly helpful to use resources from other
programming languages. R has aspects of both functional and
object-oriented (OO) programming languages. Learning how these concepts
are expressed in R will help you leverage your existing knowledge of
other programming languages, and will help you identify areas where you
can improve.

To understand why R's object systems work the way they do, I found
\href{https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html}{\emph{The
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs}} (SICP) by Harold
Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, particularly helpful. It's a concise but
deep book. After reading it, I felt for the first time that I could
actually design my own object-oriented system. The book was my first
introduction to the generic function style of OO common in R. It helped
me understand its strengths and weaknesses. SICP also talks a lot about
functional programming, and how to create simple functions which become
powerful when combined.

To understand the trade-offs that R has made compared to other
programming languages, I found
\href{http://amzn.com/0262220695?tag=devtools-20}{\emph{Concepts,
Techniques and Models of Computer Programming}} by Peter van Roy and Sef
Haridi extremely helpful. It helped me understand that R's
copy-on-modify semantics make it substantially easier to reason about
code, and that while its current implementation is not particularly
efficient, it is a solvable problem.

If you want to learn to be a better programmer, there's no place better
to turn than \href{http://amzn.com/020161622X?tag=devtools-20}{\emph{The
Pragmatic Programmer}} by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. This book is
language agnostic, and provides great advice for how to be a better
programmer.

\section{Getting help}\label{getting-help}

Currently, there are two main venues to get help when you're stuck and
can't figure out what's causing the problem:
\href{http://stackoverflow.com}{stackoverflow} and the R-help mailing
list. You can get fantastic help in both venues, but they do have their
own cultures and expectations. It's usually a good idea to spend a
little time lurking, learning about community expectations, before you
put up your first post. \index{help}

Some good general advice:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Make sure you have the latest version of R and of the package (or
  packages) you are having problems with. It may be that your problem is
  the result of a recently fixed bug.
\item
  Spend some time creating a
  \href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269}{reproducible
  example}. This is often a useful process in its own right, because in
  the course of making the problem reproducible you often figure out
  what's causing the problem.
\item
  Look for related problems before posting. If someone has already asked
  your question and it has been answered, it's much faster for everyone
  if you use the existing answer.
\end{itemize}

\section{Acknowledgments}\label{intro-ack}

I would like to thank the tireless contributors to R-help and, more
recently,
\href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r}{stackoverflow}. There
are too many to name individually, but I'd particularly like to thank
Luke Tierney, John Chambers, Dirk Eddelbuettel, JJ Allaire and Brian
Ripley for generously giving their time and correcting my countless
misunderstandings.

This book was \href{https://github.com/hadley/adv-r/}{written in the
open}, and chapters were advertised on
\href{https://twitter.com/hadleywickham}{twitter} when complete. It is
truly a community effort: many people read drafts, fixed typos,
suggested improvements, and contributed content. Without those
contributors, the book wouldn't be nearly as good as it is, and I'm
deeply grateful for their help. Special thanks go to Peter Li, who read
the book from cover-to-cover and provided many fixes. Other outstanding
contributors were Aaron Schumacher, @crtahlin, Lingbing Feng,
@juancentro, and @johnbaums. \index{contributors}

\section{Conventions}\label{conventions}

Throughout this book I use \texttt{f()} to refer to functions,
\texttt{g} to refer to variables and function parameters, and
\texttt{h/} to paths.

Larger code blocks intermingle input and output. Output is commented so
that if you have an electronic version of the book, e.g.,
\url{http://adv-r.had.co.nz}, you can easily copy and paste examples
into R. Output comments look like \texttt{\#\textgreater{}} to
distinguish them from regular comments. \index{website}
