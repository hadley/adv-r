## Introduction

Now that you understand the tree structure of R code, it's time to come back to one of the fundamental ideas that make `expr()` and `ast()` work: __quasiquotation__.  There are two sides to quasiquotation:

* __Quotation__ allows the _developer_ to capture the AST associated with a 
  function argument without evaluating it.
  
* __Unquotation__ allows the _user_ to selectively evaluate parts of an 
  expression that would otherwise be captured.

The combination of these two ideas makes it easy to compose expressions that are mixtures of direct and indirect specification, and helps to solve a wide variety of challenging problems. 

In this chapter, we'll ...

Quoting functions have deep connections to Lisp __macros__. But macros are ususally run at compile-time, which doesn't have any meaning in R, and they always input and output ASTs. (@lumley-2001 shows one way you might implement them in R). Quoting functions are more closely related to Lisp [__fexprs__](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fexpr), functions where all arguments are quoted by default. These terms are useful to know when looking for related techniques in other programming languages. \index{macros} \index{fexprs}

```{r}
if (packageVersion("rlang") < "0.1.6.9002") {
  stop("Chapter currently relies on development version of rlang")
}
```

### Motivation

We'll start with a simple and concrete example that helps motivate the need for unquoting, and hence quasiquotation. Imagine you're creating a lot of strings by joining together words:

```{r}
paste("Good", "morning", "Hadley")
paste("Good", "afternoon", "Alice")
```

You are sick and tired of writing all those quotes, and instead you just want to use bare words. To that end, you've managed to write the following function:

```{r}
cement <- function(...) {
  exprs(...) %>% 
    map(expr_name) %>% 
    paste(collapse = " ")
}

cement(Good, morning, Hadley)
cement(Good, afternoon, Alice)
```

(We'll talk about the details of this implementation later; for now just look at the results.)

Formally, this function __quotes__ the arguments in `...`. You can think of it as automatically putting quotation marks around each argument. That's not precisely true as the intermediate objects it generates are expressions, not strings, but it's a useful approximation for now.

This function is nice because we no longer need to type quotes. The problem, however, comes when we want to use variables. It's easy to use variables with `paste()` as we just don't surround them with quotes:

```{r}
name <- "Hadley"
time <- "morning"

paste("Good", time, name)
```

Obviously this doesn't work with `cement()` because every input is automatically quoted:

```{r}
cement(Good, time, name)
```

We need some way to explicitly __unquote__ the input, to tell `cement()` to remove the automatic quote marks. Here we need `time` and `name` to be treated differently to `Good`. Quasiquotation give us a standard tool to do so: `!!`, called "unquote", and prounounced bang-bang. `!!` tells a quoting function to drop the implicit quotes:

```{r}
cement(Good, !!time, !!name)
```

It's useful to compare `cement()` and `paste()` directly. `paste()` evaluates its arguments, so we need to quote where needed; `cement()` quotes its arguments, so we need to unquote where needed.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
paste("Good", time, name)
cement(Good, !!time, !!name)
```

### Theory

Now that you've seen the basic idea, it's time to talk a little bit about the theory. The idea of quasiquotation is an old one. It was first developed by a philosopher, Willard van Orman Quine[^1], in the early 1940s. It's needed in philosophy because it helps when precisely delineating the use and mention of words, i.e. between the object and the words we use to refer to that object. 

[^1]: You might be familiar with the name Quine from "quines", computer programs that when run return a copy of their own source code.

Quasiquotation was first used in a programming language, LISP, in the mid-1970s [@bawden-1999]. LISP has one quoting function `` ` ``, and uses `,` for unquoting. Most languages with a LISP heritage behave similarly. For example, racket (`` ` `` and `@`), clojure (`` ` `` and `~`), and julia (`:` and `@`) all have quasiquotation tools that different only slightly from LISP. 

Quasiquotation has only come to R recently (2017). Despite its newness, I teach it in this book because it is a rich and powerful theory that makes many hard problems much easier. Quaisquotation in R is a little different to LISP and descendents. In LISP there is only one function that does quasiquotation (the quote function), and you must call it explicitly when needed. This makes these languages less ambiguous (because there's a clear code signal that something odd is happening), but is less appropriate for R because quasiquotation is such an important part of DSLs for data analysis.

## Quotation

The first part of quasiquotation is quotation: capturing an AST without evaluating it. There are two components to this: capturing an expression directly, and capturing an expression from a lazily-evaluated functional argument. We'll discuss two sets of tools for these two ways of capturing: those provided by rlang, and those provided by base R. 

### With rlang

There are four important quoting functions. For interactive exploration, the most important quoting function is `expr()`. It captures its argument exactly as provided:

```{r}
expr(x + y)
expr(1 / 2 / 3)
```

(Remember that white space and comments are not part of the AST, so will not be captured by an quoting function.)

`expr()` is great for interactive exploration, but it's not useful inside a function, because it always returns exactly what it's called with:

```{r}
f <- function(x) expr(x)
f(x + y + z)
```

Instead, we need another function: `enexpr()`. This looks at the internal promise object that powers lazy evaluation in R and extracts the expression that was passed to the function:

```{r}
f <- function(x) enexpr(x)
f(x + y + z)
```

(Occassionaly you just want to capture symbols, and throw an error for other types of input. In that case you can use `ensym()`. In the next chapter, you'll learn about `enquo()` which also captures the environment and is needed for tidy evaluation.)

To capture multiple arguments, use `enexprs()`:

```{r}
f <- function(...) enexprs(...)
f(x = 1, y = 10 * z)
```

Finally, `exprs()` is useful interactively to make a list of expressions:

```{r}
exprs(x = x ^ 2, y = y ^ 3, z = z ^ 4)
# shorthand for
# list(x = expr(x ^ 2), y = expr(y ^ 3), z = expr(z ^ 4))
```

Use `enexpr()` and `enexprs()` inside a function when you want to capture the expressions supplied as arguments _by the user_ of that function. Use `expr()` and `exprs()` when you want to capture expressions that _you_ supply.

There's not much you can do with a list of expressions yet, but we'll see a few techniques later in [case studies](quasi-case-studies): using purrr to work with list of expressions turns out to be a surprisingly powerful tool.

### With base R

The base equivalent of `expr()` is `quote()`:
  
```{r}
quote(x + y)
quote(1 / 2 / 3)
```

It is identical to `expr()` except that does not support unquoting, so it a quoting function, not a quasiquoting function.

The base function closest to `enexpr()` is `substitute()`:

```{r}
f <- function(x) substitute(x)
f(x + y + z)
```

You'll most often see it used to capture unevaluated arguments; often in concert with `deparse()` to create labels for output. However, `substitute()` also does "substitution": if you give it an expression, rather than a symbol, it will substitute in values of symbols defined in the current environment. 

```{r}
f2 <- function(x) substitute(x * 2)
f2(x + y + z)
```

`substitute()` provides a sort of automatic unquoting for any symbol that is bound to a value. However, making use of this behaviour can make for hard to read code, because for example, taken out of context, you can't tell if the goal of `substitute(x + y)` is to replace `x`, or, `y`, or both. If you do want to use `substitute()` in this way, I recomend that you use the 2nd argument to be explicit:

```{r}
substitute(x * y * z, list(x = 10, y = quote(a + b)))
```

There is no base equivalent to `exprs()` but you could write your own:
  
```{r}
dots <- function(...) match.call(expand.dots = FALSE)$`...`
dots(x = 1, y = x + 2)
```

This uses `match.call()` which quotes the entire call to the function, not just individual arguments. You'll see `match.call()` frequently used in modelling functions as way of capturing the complete model specification so that it can be printed in output:

```{r}
mod <- lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
mod$call
```

We'll come back to `match.call()` in the next chapter; unfortunately its semantics means that you must be very careful when using it for anything other than labelling.

There are two other important base quoting functions that we'll cover in depth elsewhere:

* `bquote()` provides a limited form of quasiquotation, and is discussed in 
  [unquoting with base R](#unquote-base). 
  
* `~`, the formula, is a quoting function that also captures the environment. 
  It's the inspiration for quosures, and is discussed in [formulas].

### Exercises

1.  What happens if you try and use `enexpr()` with an expression?
    What happens if you try and use `enexpr()` with a missing argument?

1.  Compare and contrast the following two functions. Can you predict the
    ouput before running them?

    ```{r, result = FALSE}
    f1 <- function(x, y) {
      exprs(x = x, y = y)
    }
    f2 <- function(x, y) {
      enexprs(x = x, y = y)
    }
    f1(a + b, c + d)
    f2(a + b, c + d)
    ```

1.  What does the following command return? What information is lost? Why?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    expr({
      x +              y # comment  
    })
    ```

1.  The documentation for `substitute()` says:

    > Substitution takes place by examining each component of the parse tree 
    > as follows: If it is not a bound symbol in env, it is unchanged. If it
    > is a promise object, i.e., a formal argument to a function or explicitly 
    created using delayedAssign(), the expression slot of the promise replaces 
    > the symbol. If it is an ordinary variable, its value is substituted, 
    > unless env is .GlobalEnv in which case the symbol is left unchanged.
    
    Create four examples that illustrate each of the different cases.

1.  Why does `as.Date.default()` use `substitute()` and `deparse()`?
    Why does `pairwise.t.test()` use them? Read the source code.

1.  `pairwise.t.test()` assumes that `deparse()` always returns a length one 
    character vector. Can you construct an input that violates this expectation? 
    What happens?

## Evaluation

Typically you have quoted a function argument for one of two reasons:

* You want to operate on the AST using the techniques described in the
  previous chapter.
  
* You want to run, or __evaluate__ the code in a special context,
  as described in depth next chapter.

Evaluation is a rich topic, so it gets a complete chapter. Here we'll just illustrate the most important ideas. The most important base R function is `base::eval()`. Its first argument is the expression to evalute:

```{r}
ru5 <- expr(runif(5))
ru5

eval(ru5)
eval(ru5)
```

Note that every time we evaluate this expression we get a different result.

The second argument to `eval()` is the environment in which the expression is evaluated. Manipulating the functions in this environment give us amazing power to control the execution of R code. This is the basic technique gives dplyr the ability to turn R code into SQL.

```{r}
x <- 9
fx <- expr(f(x))

eval(fx, env(f = function(x) x * 10))
eval(fx, env(f = function(x) x ^ 2))
```

## Unquotation

Evaluation is a developer tool: in combination with quoting, it allows the author of a function to capture an argument and evaluate it in a special way. Unquoting is related to evaluation, but it's a user tool: it allows the person calling the function to selectively evaluate parts of the expresion that would otherwise be quoted. 

Another way of thinking about unquoting is that it provides a code template: you define an AST with some "holes" that get filled in using unquoting. 

### With rlang

All quoting functions in rlang (`expr()`, `enexpr()`, and friends) supporting unquoting with `!!` (called "unquote", and pronounced bang-bang) and `!!!` (called "unquote-splice", and pronounced bang-bang-bang). They both replace nodes in the AST. `!!` is a one-to-one replacement. It takes a single expression and inlines the AST at the location of the `!!`. 

```{r}
x <- expr(a + b + c)
expr(f(!!x, y))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/expression-bang-bang.png", dpi = 450)
```

`!!!` is a one-to-many replacement. It takes a list of expressions and inserts them at them at the location of the `!!!`:

```{r}
x <- exprs(1, 2, 3, y = 10)
expr(f(!!!x, z = z))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/expression-bang-bang-bang.png", dpi = 450)
```

### With base R {#unquote-base}

Base R has one function that implements a form of quasiquotation: `bquote()`. It uses `.()` for unquoting, and does not support unquote-splicing. 

```{r}
xyz <- expr((x + y + z))
bquote(- .(xyz) / 2)
```

`bquote()` is not used to provide quasiquotation for any other function in R so functions that quote an arugment must use some other technique to allow indirect specification. There are four basic forms seen in base R:

```{r, include = FALSE}
call <- names(pryr::find_uses("package:base", "match.call"))
subs <- names(pryr::find_uses("package:base", "substitute"))
eval <- names(pryr::find_uses("package:base", "eval"))

intersect(subs, eval)
```

*   A pair of quoting and non-quoting functions. For example, `$` has two 
    arguments, and the second argument is quoted. This is easier to see if you 
    write in prefix form: `mtcars$cyl` is equivalent to `` `$`(mtcars, cyl) ``. 
    If you want to refer to a variable indirectly, you use `[[`, as it 
    takes the name of a variable as a string.
      
    ```{r}
    x <- list(var = 1, y = 2)
    var <- "y"
    
    x$var
    x[[var]]
    ```
  
    `<-`/`assign()` and `::`/`getExportedValue()` work similarly.

*   A pair of quoting and non-quoting arguments. For example, `data()`, `rm()`, 
    and `save()` allow you to provide bare variable names in `...`, or a 
    character vector of variable names in `list`.

    ```{r}
    x <- 1
    rm(x)

    y <- 2
    vars <- c("y", "vars")
    rm(list = vars)
    ```

*   An argument that controls whether a different argument is quoting or 
    non-quoting. For example, in `library()`, the `character.only` argument
    controls the quoting behaviour of of the first argument, `package`:
    
    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(MASS)
    
    pkg <- "MASS"
    library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
    ```
    
    `demo()`, `detach()`, `example()`, and `require()` work similarly.

*   Quoting if evaluation fails. For example, the first argument to `help()`
    is non-quoting if it's an existing variable name (that points to a string);
    otherwise it is quoting. 
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Shows help for var
    help(var)
    
    var <- "mean"
    # Shows help for mean
    help(var)
    
    var <- 10
    # Shows help for var
    help(var)
    ```
    
    `ls()`, `page()`, and `match.fun()` work similarly. 

Some quoting functions, like `subset()`, `transform()`, and `with()`, don't have a non-quoting form. This is because they are primarily wrappers around `[` and `[<-`. 

Another important class of quoting functions are base modelling and plotting functions, which quote some of their arguments. For `lm()` quotes the `weight` and `subset` arguments, and when used with a formula argument, the plotting function quote the aesthetic arguments (`col`, `cex`, etc):

```{r}
palette(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, "Set1"))
plot(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length, data = iris, col = Species, pch = 20, cex = 2)
```

These functions follow the so-called standard non-standard evaluation rules: <http://developer.r-project.org/nonstandard-eval.pdf>. 

### Non-standard ASTs

Using unquoting, it is possible to create non-standard ASTs, i.e. ASTs that contain components that are not constants, symbols, or calls. These are valid, and occassionally useful, but it's most important to understand what's going on because R's default print method does not always accurately reflect the underlying tree. For example, R will display integer sequences as if they were generated with `:`.

```{r}
x2 <- expr(f(!!c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L)))
x2
lobstr::ast(!!x2)
```

And if you inline more complex objects, their attributes are not printed which might lead to confusing output:

```{r}
x3 <- expr(class(!!data.frame(x = 10)))
x3
eval(x3)
```

Finally, R will print parentheses that don't exist in the call tree:

```{r}
y1 <- expr(2 + 3)
x1 <- expr(1 + !!y1)
x1
lobstr::ast(!!x1)
```

In general, if you're ever confused about what is actually in an AST, display the object with `ast()`!

### The polite fiction of `!!`

So far we have pretended that `!!` and `!!!` are real prefix operators like `+` , `-`, and `!`: they're not. rlang enforces the polite fiction to make life easier, but from R's perspective `!!` is not a single syntactic entity but simply two `!` next to each other:

```{r}
!!TRUE
```

rlang chose `!!` and `!!!` for unquoting because they're clear visual symbol that something different is going on, and it's very rare to need double or triple negative as part of idiomatic R code. 

The polite fiction runs deeps, and includes giving `!!` and `!!!` precedence similar to `+` and `-`, rather than to `!`. The operator precedence for `!` is suprisingly low: it has lower precedence that than of the binary algebraic and logical operators. Most of the time this doesn't matter as it is unusual to mix `!` and binary operators (e.g. `!x + y` or !x > y`). Expressions like `!!x + !!y` are not uncommon when unquoting, and requring `(!!x) + (!!y)` feels onerous (and introduces spurious parentheses into the AST). For this reason, rlang manipulates the AST to give the unquoting operators a more natural precedence.

(If for some reason you do need to doubly negate a value in a quasiquoting function, just add a pair of parentheses `!(!x)`.)

### Exercises

1.  Base functions `match.fun()`, `page()`, and `ls()` all try to
    automatically determine whether you want standard or non-standard
    evaluation. Each uses a different approach. Figure out the essence
    of each approach then compare and contrast.

1.  The following two calls print the same, but are actually different:

    ```{r}
    (a <- expr(mean(1:10)))
    (b <- expr(mean(!!(1:10))))
    identical(a, b)
    ```

    What's the difference? Which one is more natural?

## Case studies {#quasi-case-studies}

### Calling quoting functions

One downside of non-standard evaluation 

A function is __referentially transparent__ if you can replace its arguments with their values and its behaviour doesn't change. For example, if a function, `f()`, is referentially transparent and both `x` and `y` are 10, then `f(x)`, `f(y)`, and `f(10)` will all return the same result. This is clearly not 

```{r}
x <- runif(5)

(exp(2 * x) - exp(-2 * x)) / (exp(2 * x) + exp(-2 * x))

y <- 2*x
(exp(y) - exp(-y)) / (exp(y) + exp(-y))

sinh_y <- (exp(y) - exp(-y)) / 2
cosh_y <- (exp(y) + exp(-y)) / 2
sinh_y / cosh_y
```

The biggest downside of NSE is that functions that use it are no longer [referentially transparent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)). If you want to call a quoting function inside another function you need to quote and unquote.

```{r}
expr((exp(2 * x) - exp(-2 * x)) / (exp(2 * x) + exp(-2 * x)))

y <- 2 * x
expr((exp(y) - exp(-y)) / (exp(y) + exp(-y)))

y <- expr(2 * x)
expr((exp(!!y) - exp(-!!y)) / (exp(!!y) + exp(-!!y)))
```

Referentially transparent code is easier to reason about because the names of objects don't matter, and because you can always work from the innermost parentheses outwards. You can simplify code by introducing named intermediates. \index{non-standard evaluation!drawbacks} \index{referential transparency}

There are many important functions that by their very nature are not referentially transparent. Take the assignment operator. You can't take `a <- 1` and replace `a` by its value and get the same behaviour. This is one reason that people usually write assignments at the top-level of functions. It's hard to reason about code like this:

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 2
if ((b <- a + 1) > (a <- b - 1)) {
  b <- b + 2
}
```

Not all functions can be referentially transparent, but it's worth striving for.

### Reducing duplication in dplyr

We can use these ideas to generate out own wrappers around dplyr functions. For example, imagine we want to group by one variable and compute the mean of another. We use `enexpr()` to capture the expression, and then unquoting to selectively evaluation.

```{r}
grouped_mean <- function(df, group_by, summarise) {
  group_by <- enexpr(group_by)
  summarise <- enexpr(summarise)
  
  df %>%
    group_by(!!group_by) %>%
    summarise(mean(!!summarise))
}
```

We can combine this idea with the previous by creating a wrapper around `desc()` that arranges all components in descrending order. We capture the dots with `exprs()`, wrap each in `desc()` by combining `map()` and `expr()`, and the use `!!!` to insert all expressions into `arrange()`.

```{r}
arrange_desc <- function(df, ...) {
  dots <- exprs(...)
  dots_desc <- map(dots, function(var) expr(desc(!!var)))
  
  dplyr::arrange(df, !!!dots_desc)
}
```

We'll come back to this case study in more detail in the next chapter. To be 100% correct, we need to use `quo()` rathrer than `expr()` for reasons we'll come back to shortly.

### Generating code

Quoting and unquoting give us powerful tools for generating code, particularly when combined with `purrr::map()` and `purr::reduce()`. For example, assume you have a linear model specified by the following coefficients:

```{r}
intercept <- 10
coefs <- c(x1 = 5, x2 = -4)
```

You want to convert it into an expression like `10 + (5 * x1) + (-4 * x2)` so you can evaluate it with new data. The first thing we need to turn is turn the character names vector into a list of symbols. `rlang::syms()` is designed precisely for this case:

```{r}
coef_sym <- syms(names(coefs))
coef_sym
```

Next we need to combine each variable name with its coefficient. We can do this by combining `expr()` with map `map2()`:

```{r}
summands <- map2(coef_sym, coefs, ~ expr((UQ(.x) * UQ(.y))))
summands
```

In this case, the intercept is also a part of the sum, although it doesn't involve a multiplication. We can just add it to the start:

```{r}
summands <- c(intercept, summands)
summands
```

Finally, we need to reduce the individual terms in to a single sum by adding the pieces together:

```{r}
eq <- reduce(summands, ~ expr(UQ(.x) + UQ(.y)))
eq
```

Very many code generation problems can be solved in a similar way, combining quasiquotation with map functions.

## Parition

Inspired by <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46828296/>.

```{r}
make_minus <- function(x) expr(-!!x)

partition <- function(x, ...) {
  vars <- enquos(...)
  excluded_vars <- map(vars, make_minus)

  included <- select(x, ...)
  excluded <- select(x, !!!excluded_vars)
  list(included, excluded)
}
```

## Dot-dot-dot (`...`)

Quasiquotation ensures that every quoted argument has an escape hatch that allows the user to unquote, or evaluated, selected components, if needed. A similar and related needs arises with functions that take arbitrary additional arguments with `...`. Take the following two motivation problems:

*   What do you do if the elements you want to put in `...` are already stored 
    in a list? For example, imagine you have a list of data frames that 
    you want to `rbind()` together:
    
    ```{r}
    dfs <- list(
      a = data.frame(x = 1, y = 2),
      b = data.frame(x = 3, y = 4)
    )
    ```
    
    You could solve this specific case with `rbind(dfs$a, df$b)`, but how
    do you generalise that solution to a list of arbitrary length?

*   What do you do if you want to supply the argument name indirectly? For 
    example, imagine you want to create a single column data frame where 
    the name of the column is specified in a variable:
    
    ```{r}
    var <- "x"
    val <- c(4, 3, 9)
    ```
    
    In this case, you could create a data frame and then change names
    (ie. `setNames(data.frame(val), var)`), but this feels inelegant.
    How can we do better?

### `do.call()`

Base R provides a swiss-army knife to solve these problems: `do.call()`. `do.call()` has two main arguments. The first argument, `what`, gives a funtion to call. The second argument, `args`, is a list of arguments to pass to that function, and so `do.call("f", list(x, y, z))` is equivalent to `f(x, y, z)`.

`do.call()` gives a straightforward solution to `rbind()`ing together many data frames:

```{r}
do.call("rbind", dfs)
```

With a little more work, we can use `do.call()` to solve the second problem. We first create a list of argumetns, then name that, then use `do.call()`:

```{r}
args <- list(val)
names(args) <- var

do.call("data.frame", args)
```

### The tidyverse approach

An alternative way to solve this problems hinges on the recognition that we can reframe these problems as a need for splicing and unquoting argument names. For example, the tidyverse equivalents of `rbind()` and `data.frame()`, `dplyr::bind_rows()` and `tibble::tibble()`, do not require an additional helper, instead using the same syntax as unquoting:

```{r}
dplyr::bind_rows(!!!dfs)

tibble::tibble(!!var := val)
```

Note the use of `:=` (pronounced colon-equals) rather than `=`. Unforunately we need this new operation because R's grammar does not allow expressions as argument names:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tibble::tibble(!!var = value)
#> Error: unexpected '=' in "tibble::tibble(!!var ="
```

`:=` is like a vestigal organ: it's recognised by R's parser, but it doesn't have any code associated with it. It looks like an `=` but allows expressions on either side, making it a more flexible alternative to `=`. It is used in data.table for similar reasons.

When used in this context, the behaviour of `!!!` is sometimes called spatting. It is closed related to star-args (`*args`) and star-star-kwargs (`**kwarg`) in Python.

### `dots_list()`

Both `dplyr::bind_rows()` and `tibble::tibble()` are powered by `rlang::dots_list(...)`. This function is very similar to `list(...)`, but it interprets `!!!` and `!!` specially. If you want to take advantage of this behaviour in your own function, all you need to do is use `dots_list()` in your own code.

For example, imagine you want to make a version of `structure()` that understands `!!!` and `!!`. We'll call it `set_attr()`:

```{r}
set_attr <- function(.x, ...) {
  attr <- rlang::dots_list(...)
  attributes(.x) <- attr
  .x
}

attrs <- list(x = 1, y = 2)
attr_name <- "z"

1:10 %>%
  set_attr(w = 0, !!!attrs, !!attr_name := 3) %>% 
  str()
```

(rlang also provides a `set_attr()` function with a few extra conveniences, but the essence is the same.)

Note that we call the first argument `.x`: whenever you use `...` to take arbitrary data, it's good practice to give the other argument names a `.` prefix. This eliminates any ambiguity about argument names.

`dots_list()` provides one other handy feature: by default it will ignore any empty argument at the end. This is useful in functions like `tibble::tibble()` because it means that you can easily change the order of variables without worrying about the final comma:

```{r, results = FALSE}
# Can easily move x to first entry:
tibble::tibble(
  y = 1:5,
  z = 3:-1,
  x = 5:1,
)

# Need to remove comma from z and add column to x
data.frame(
  y = 1:5,
  z = 3:-1,
  x = 5:1
)
```

Use the `.ignore_empty()` argument to change this behaviour.

### `invoke()` and `lang()`

One useful application of `dots_list()` is `invoke()`:

```{r}
invoke <- function(.f, ...) {
  do.call(.f, dots_list(...), envir = parent.frame())
}
```

(At time of writing, `purrr::invoke()` and `rlang::invoke()` had somewhat different definitions because they were written before we understood how quasiquotation syntax and `...` intersected.)

As a wrapper around `do.call()`, `invoke()` gives powerful ways to call functions with arguments supplied directly (in ...) or indirectly (in a list):

```{r, results = FALSE}
invoke("mean", x = 1:10, na.rm = TRUE)

# Equivalent to
x <- list(x = 1:10, na.rm = TRUE)
invoke("mean", !!!x)
```

It also allows us to specify argument names indirectly:

```{r, results = FALSE}
arg_name <- "na.rm"
arg_val <- TRUE
invoke("mean", 1:10, !!arg_name := arg_val)
```

Closely related to `invoke()` is `lang()`:

```{r}
lang("mean", 1:10, !!arg_name := arg_val)
```

 `lang()` generates an expression and is often equivalent to `expr()`. The advantage of `lang()` is that you can use `:=`: you can't use it with `expr()` because it does not take `...`.
 
### Other approaches

Apart from `rlang::dots_list()` there are several other techniques used to overcome the difficulties described above. One technique is is to take `...` but also accept a single unnamed argument that is a list, making `f(list(x, y, z))` equivalent to `f(x, y, z)`. The implementation looks something like:

```{r}
f <- function(...) {
  dots <- list(...)
  if (length(dots) == 1 && is.list(dots[[1]])) {
    dots <- dots[[1]]
  }
  
  # Do something
  ...
}
```

Base functions that use this technique include `interaction()`, `expand.grid()`, `options()`, and `par()`. Since these functions take either a list, or a `...`, but not both, they are slightly less flexible than functions powered by `dots_list()`.

Another related technique is used the `RCurl::getURL()` function written by Duncan Temple Lang. `getURL()` take both `...` and `.opts` which are concatenated together.  This is useful when writing functions to call web APIs because you often have some options that need to be passed to request. You put these in a common list and pass to `.opts`, saving `...` for the options unique for a given call. 

I found this technique particular compelling so you can see it used throughout the tidyverse. Now, however, `rlang::dots_list()` dots solves more problems, more elegantly, by using the ideas from tidy eval so the tidyverse is slowly migrating to fsthat style.

### Exercises

1.  Carefully read the source code for `interaction()`, `expand.grid()`, and 
    `par()`.  Compare and constract the techniques they use for switching 
    between dots and list behaviour.

1.  Explain the problem with this defintion of `set_attr()`
    
    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    set_attr <- function(x, ...) {
      attr <- rlang::dots_list(...)
      attributes(x) <- attr
      x
    }
    set_attr(1:10, x = 10)
    ```
