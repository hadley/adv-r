A __functional__ is a function that takes a function as an input and returns a vector as output. Here's a simple functional: it calls the function provided as input with 1000 random uniform numbers. 

```{r}
randomise <- function(f) f(runif(1e3))
randomise(mean)
randomise(mean)
randomise(sum)
```

The chances are that you've already used a functional. You might have used for-loop replacement like base R's `lapply()`, `apply()`, or `tapply()`, or maybe purrr's `map()` or variant; or maybe you've used a mathemetical functional like `integrate()` or `optim()`. All functionals take a function as input (among other things) and return a vector as output.

A common use of functionals is as an alternative to for loops. For loops have a bad rap in R. They have a reputation for being slow (although that reputation is only partly true, see Section \@ref(single-binding) for more details). But the real downside of for loops is that they're not very expressive. A for loop conveys that it's iterating over something, but doesn't clearly convey a high level goal. Instead of using a for loop, it's better to use a functional. Each functional is tailored for a specific task, so when you recognise the functional you immediately know why it's being used. Functionals play other roles as well as replacements for for-loops. They are useful for encapsulating common data manipulation tasks like split-apply-combine, for thinking "functionally", and for working with mathematical functions. 

Functionals reduce bugs in your code by better communicating intent. Functionals implemented in base R are well tested (i.e., bug-free) and efficient, because they're used by so many people. Many are written in C, and use special tricks to enhance performance. That said, using functionals will not always produce the fastest code. Instead, it helps you clearly communicate and build tools that solve a wide range of problems. It's a mistake to focus on speed until you know it'll be a problem. Once you have clear, correct code you can make it fast using the techniques you'll learn in Section \@ref(profiling).

### Prerequisites {-}

This chapter will focus on functionals provided by the purrr package. These functions have a consistent interface that makes it easier to understand the key ideas than their base equivalents, which have grown organically over many years. I'll compare and contrast base R functions as we go, and then wrap up the chapter with a discussion of base functionals that don't have purrr equivalents.

```{r setup}
library(purrr)
```

Many R users feel guilty about using for loops instead of the apply functions that they know they should. It's natural to blame yourself for failing to understand and internalise these functions, but I think some blame goes to the falls to the design of the funtions as their lack of consistency makes them  ...

## My first functional: `map()` {#map}
\indexc{map()}

The simplest functional is `map()`, which you may already be familiar with. `map()` takes a function, applies it to each element in a list, and returns the results in the form of a list. `map()` is the building block for many other functionals, so it's important to understand how it works. Here's a pictorial representation: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/functionals/map.png")
```

::: sidebar

You might be more familiar with the base R equivalent of `map()`, `lapply()`. The are only a couple of advantages of `map()` over `lapply()`, and these usually aren't strong it enough to make it worthwhile to a single `map()` instead of an isolated `lapply()`. The advantage of `map()` is that it's part of a consistent family of functions.

:::

::: sidebar

Why is it called map?

:::

`map()` is written in C for performance, but we can create a simple R implementation that does the same thing:

```{r}
my_map_dbl <- function(x, f, ...) {
  out <- double(length(x))
  for (i in seq_along(x)) {
    out[[i]] <- f(x[[i]], ...)
  }
  out
}
```

(Main difference is that this doesn't do any checking that `f(x[[i]])` returns the correct sort of object)

From this code, you can see that `map()` is a wrapper for a common for loop pattern: create a container for output, apply `f()` to each component of a list, and fill the container with the results. All other for loop functionals are variations on this theme: they simply use different types of input or output.

`map()` makes it easier to work with vectors by eliminating much of the boilerplate associated with looping. This allows you to focus on the function that you're applying:

```{r}
# Create some random data
l <- replicate(10, runif(sample(1:10, 1)), simplify = FALSE)

# With a for loop
out <- double(length(l))
for (i in seq_along(l)) {
  out[[i]] <- mean(l[[i]])
}
out

# With lapply
my_map_dbl(l, mean)
```

(I'm using `unlist()` to convert the output from a list to a vector to make it more compact. We'll see other ways of making the output a vector shortly.)

Since data frames are also lists, `map()` is also useful when you want to do something to each column of a data frame: \index{data frames!modifying each column}

```{r}
# What class is each column?
unlist(map(mtcars, class))

# Divide each column by the mean
mtcars[] <- map(mtcars, function(x) x / mean(x))
```

Doing something to each row, or group of rows...

### Map helpers

```{r, eval = FALSE}
map(x, ~ f(.x, y))
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
map(x, "x")
map(x, 1)
map(x, list("x", 1))
```


### Passing arguments {#passing-arguments}

The pieces of `x` are always supplied as the first argument to `f`. If you want to vary a different argument, you can use an anonymous function. The following example varies the amount of trimming applied when computing the mean of a fixed `x`.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/functionals/map-arg.png")
```

What if you want the constant to be the first argument?

```{r}
trims <- c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5)
x <- rcauchy(1000)

unlist(map(trims, mean, x = x))
unlist(map(trims, function(trim) mean(x, trim = trim)))
```

Note that `map(x, f, y = y)` and `map(x, ~ f(x, y = y))` are not always identical. In the first form `y` is evaluated once, in the second form it's evaluated multiple times. Compare the following calls:

```{r}
library(purrr)
plus <- function(x, y) x + y

map_dbl(rep(0, 3), plus, runif(1))
map_dbl(rep(0, 3), ~ plus(.x, runif(1)))
```

### `.x` vs `x`

If you compare the defintion of `my_map()` to `map()` you'll notice one important difference:

```{r}
args(my_map_dbl)
args(map_dbl)
```

All the arguments to purrr's `map()` functions use a `.` prefix. That's important because ...

```{r}
x <- rcauchy(100)
trim <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.9)
map_dbl(trim, mean, x = x)
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
my_map_dbl(trim, mean, x = x)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# equivalent to
my_map_dbl(x = x, f = trim, mean)
```

(Note of course that this technique isn't perfect - if `f()` also has arguments that start with `.` you'll have problems. However, this technique avoids 95% of issues, and otherwise you can supply an anonymous function or formula to make sure arguments go to the right place.)

If you writing your own functional that passes `...` along, it's good practice to use `.` as a suffix.

## Map variants {#functionals-loop}

The key to using functionals in place of for loops is recognising that common looping patterns are already implemented in existing base functionals. Once you've mastered these existing functionals, the next step is to start writing your own: if you discover you're duplicating the same looping pattern in many places, you should extract it out into its own function.

The following sections build on `map()` and discuss:

* `map_lgl()`, `map_int()`, `map_dbl()`, and `map_chr()` variants of 
  `map()` that produce atomic vectors of specified types.

* `map2()` and `pmap()` which iterate over multiple __input__ vectors in 
  parallel.

* The furrr package, which provides equivalents to purrr functions that work 
  across multiple backends.

### Other outputs

`sapply()` and `vapply()` are very similar to `map()` except they simplify their output to produce an atomic vector. While `sapply()` guesses, `vapply()` takes an additional argument specifying the output type. `sapply()` is great for interactive use because it saves typing, but if you use it inside your functions you'll get weird errors if you supply the wrong type of input. `vapply()` is more verbose, but gives more informative error messages and never fails silently. It is better suited for use inside other functions. \indexc{sapply()} \indexc{vapply()}

The following example illustrates these differences. When given a data frame, `sapply()` and `vapply()` return the same results. When given an empty list, `sapply()` returns another empty list instead of the more correct zero-length logical vector.

::: sidebar

Why not `sapply()`? Or `vapply()`?
:::

### Two inputs

With `lapply()`, only one argument to the function varies; the others are fixed. This makes it poorly suited for some problems. For example, how would you find a weighted mean when you have two lists, one of observations and the other of weights? \indexc{Map()}

```{r}
# Generate some sample data
xs <- replicate(5, runif(10), simplify = FALSE)
ws <- replicate(5, rpois(10, 5) + 1, simplify = FALSE)
```

It's easy to use `map_dbl()` to compute the unweighted means:

```{r}
map_dbl(xs, mean)
```

But how could we supply the weights to `weighted.mean()`? `lapply(x, means, w)` won't work because the additional arguments to `lapply()` are passed to every call. We could change looping forms:

```{r}
map_dbl(seq_along(xs), function(i) {
  weighted.mean(xs[[i]], ws[[i]])
})
```

This works, but it's a little clumsy. A cleaner alternative is to use `map2()`, a variant of `map()` that iterates over two arguments:

```{r}
map2_dbl(xs, ws, weighted.mean)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/functionals/map2.png")
```

Note that the order of arguments is a little different: function is the first argument for `Map()` and the second for `lapply()`.

This is equivalent to:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stopifnot(length(xs) == length(ws))
out <- vector("list", length(xs))
for (i in seq_along(xs)) {
  out[[i]] <- weighted.mean(xs[[i]], ws[[i]])
}
```

There's a natural equivalence between `Map()` and `lapply()` because you can always convert a `Map()` to an `lapply()` that iterates over indices. But using `Map()` is more concise, and more clearly indicates what you're trying to do.

`Map` is useful whenever you have two (or more) lists (or data frames) that you need to process in parallel. For example, another way of standardising columns is to first compute the means and then divide by them. We could do this with `lapply()`, but if we do it in two steps, we can more easily check the results at each step, which is particularly important if the first step is more complicated.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtmeans <- lapply(mtcars, mean)
mtmeans[] <- Map(`/`, mtcars, mtmeans)

# In this case, equivalent to
mtcars[] <- lapply(mtcars, function(x) x / mean(x))
```

If some of the arguments should be fixed and constant, use an anonymous function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Map(function(x, w) weighted.mean(x, w, na.rm = TRUE), xs, ws)
```

We'll see a more compact way to express the same idea in the next chapter.

::: sidebar

You may be more familiar with `mapply()` than `Map()`. I prefer `Map()` because:

* It's equivalent to `mapply` with `simplify = FALSE`, which is almost always 
  what you want.

* Instead of using an anonymous function to provide constant inputs, `mapply` 
  has the `MoreArgs` argument that takes a list of extra arguments that will 
  be supplied, as is, to each call. This breaks R's usual lazy evaluation 
  semantics, and is inconsistent with other functions.

In brief, `mapply()` adds more complication for little gain. \indexc{mapply()}
:::

### Any number of inputs


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/functionals/pmap.png")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/functionals/pmap-3.png")
```

### Modify


### Lists of functions {#lists-of-functions}

In R, functions can be stored in lists. This makes it easier to work with groups of related functions, in the same way a data frame makes it easier to work with groups of related vectors. \index{lists!of functions}

We'll start with a simple benchmarking example. Imagine you are comparing the performance of multiple ways of computing the arithmetic mean. You could do this by storing each approach (function) in a list:

```{r}
compute_mean <- list(
  base = function(x) mean(x),
  sum = function(x) sum(x) / length(x),
  manual = function(x) {
    total <- 0
    n <- length(x)
    for (i in seq_along(x)) {
      total <- total + x[i] / n
    }
    total
  }
)
```

Calling a function from a list is straightforward. You extract it then call it:

```{r}
x <- runif(1e5)
system.time(compute_mean$base(x))
system.time(compute_mean[[2]](x))
system.time(compute_mean[["manual"]](x))
```

To call each function (e.g., to check that they all return the same results), use `lapply()`. We'll need either an anonymous function or a new named function, since there isn't a built-in function to handle this situation.

```{r}
invoke_map(compute_mean, x = x)
```

Another use for a list of functions is to summarise an object in multiple ways. To do that, we could store each summary function in a list, and then run them all with `lapply()`:

```{r}
funs <- list(
  sum = sum,
  mean = mean,
  median = median
)
invoke_map(funs, x = x)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1:10, NA)
invoke_map(funs, x = x, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Parallelisation
\index{parallel computing} 
\index{multicore}
\index{bootstrapping}

One interesting thing about the implementation of `map()` is that because each iteration is isolated from all others, the order in which they are computed doesn't matter. This has a very important consequence: since we can compute each element in any order, it's easy to dispatch the tasks to different cores, and compute them in parallel. This is the idea behind the furrr package which combines the interface of purrr with the backends of future.

```{r}
library(furrr)
future::plan(multiprocess)
```

```{r, cache = TRUE}
boot_df <- function(x) x[sample(nrow(x), replace = T), ]
rsquared <- function(mod) summary(mod)$r.squared
boot_lm <- function(i) {
  rsquared(lm(mpg ~ wt + disp, data = boot_df(mtcars)))
}

system.time(lapply(1:500, boot_lm))
system.time(parallel::mclapply(1:500, boot_lm, mc.cores = 4))
system.time(future_map(1:500, boot_lm))
```

While increasing the number of cores will not always lead to linear improvement, switching from `lapply()` or `Map()` to its parallelised forms can dramatically improve computational performance.

### Exercises

1.  Use `vapply()` to:
    
    a) Compute the standard deviation of every column in a numeric data frame.
    
    a) Compute the standard deviation of every numeric column in a mixed data
       frame. (Hint: you'll need to use `vapply()` twice.)

1.  The following code simulates the performance of a t-test for non-normal 
    data. Use `sapply()` and an anonymous function to extract the p-value from 
    every trial.

    ```{r}
    trials <- replicate(
      100, 
      t.test(rpois(10, 10), rpois(7, 10)),
      simplify = FALSE
    )
    ```
    
    Extra challenge: get rid of the anonymous function by using `[[` directly.

1.  What does `replicate()` do? What sort of for loop does it eliminate? Why 
    do its arguments differ from `lapply()` and friends?

1.  Implement a version of `lapply()` that supplies `FUN` with both the name 
    and the value of each component.

1.  Implement a combination of `Map()` and `vapply()` to create an `lapply()`
    variant that iterates in parallel over all of its inputs and stores its 
    outputs in a vector (or a matrix). What arguments should the function 
    take?

1.  Implement `mcsapply()`, a multicore version of `sapply()`. Can you
    implement `mcvapply()`, a parallel version of `vapply()`? Why or why not?

## Creating your own functional: rolling computations

What if you need a for loop replacement that doesn't exist in base R? You can often create your own by recognising common looping structures and implementing your own wrapper. For example, you might be interested in smoothing your data using a rolling (or running) mean function: \index{rolling calculation}

```{r roll-mean, small_mar = TRUE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
rollmean <- function(x, n) {
  out <- rep(NA, length(x))

  offset <- trunc(n / 2)
  for (i in (offset + 1):(length(x) - n + offset + 1)) {
    out[i] <- mean(x[(i - offset):(i + offset - 1)])
  }
  out
}
x <- seq(1, 3, length = 1e2) + runif(1e2)
plot(x)
lines(rollmean(x, 5), col = "blue", lwd = 2)
lines(rollmean(x, 10), col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

But if the noise was more variable (i.e., it has a longer tail), you might worry that your rolling mean was too sensitive to outliers. Instead, you might want to compute a rolling median.

```{r outliers, small_mar = TRUE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
x <- seq(1, 3, length = 1e2) + rt(1e2, df = 2) / 3
plot(x)
lines(rollmean(x, 5), col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

To change `rollmean()` to `rollmedian()`, all you need to do is replace `mean` with `median` inside the loop. But instead of copying and pasting to create a new function, we could extract the idea of computing a rolling summary into its own function: \indexc{rollapply()}

```{r roll-apply, small_mar = TRUE, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
rollapply <- function(x, n, f, ...) {
  out <- rep(NA, length(x))

  offset <- trunc(n / 2)
  for (i in (offset + 1):(length(x) - n + offset + 1)) {
    out[i] <- f(x[(i - offset):(i + offset - 1)], ...)
  }
  out
}
plot(x)
lines(rollapply(x, 5, median), col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

You might notice that the internal loop looks pretty similar to a `vapply()` loop, so we could rewrite the function as:

```{r roll-apply-2}
rollapply <- function(x, n, f, ...) {
  offset <- trunc(n / 2)
  locs <- (offset + 1):(length(x) - n + offset + 1)
  num <- vapply(
    locs, 
    function(i) f(x[(i - offset):(i + offset)], ...),
    numeric(1)
  )

  c(rep(NA, offset), num)
}
```

This is effectively the same as the implementation in `zoo::rollapply()`, which provides many more features and much more error checking.

## Looping patterns
\index{loops!common patterns}
\index{loops!when to use}

It's useful to remember that there are three basic ways to loop over a vector: 

* Loop over the elements: `for (x in xs)`
* Loop over the numeric indices: `for (i in seq_along(xs))`
* Loop over the names: `for (nm in names(xs))`

And each has a direct analog with a functional.

These are also three common looping patterns that _don't_ have a functional equivalent: 

* Modifying in place.
* Recursive functions.
* While loops.

It's possible to torture these problems to use a functional, but it's not a good idea. You'll create code that is harder to understand, eliminating the main reason for using functionals in the first case.

### Looping patterns

The first form is usually not a good choice for a for loop because it leads to inefficient ways of saving output. With this form it's very natural to save the output by extending a data structure, like in this example:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
xs <- runif(1e3)
res <- c()
for (x in xs) {
  # This is slow!
  res <- c(res, sqrt(x))
}
```

This is slow because each time you extend the vector, R has to copy all of the existing elements. [Avoid copies](#avoid-copies) discusses this problem in more depth. Instead, it's much better to create the space you'll need for the output and then fill it in. This is easiest with the second form: \index{avoiding copies}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
res <- numeric(length(xs))
for (i in seq_along(xs)) {
  res[i] <- sqrt(xs[i])
}
```

Just as there are three basic ways to use a for loop, there are three basic ways to use `lapply()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lapply(xs, function(x) {})
lapply(seq_along(xs), function(i) {})
lapply(names(xs), function(nm) {})
```

Typically you'd use the first form because `lapply()` takes care of saving the output for you. However, if you need to know the position or name of the element you're working with, you should use the second or third form. Both give you an element's position (`i`, `nm`) and value (`xs[[i]]`, `xs[[nm]]`). If you're struggling to solve a problem using one form, you might find it easier with another.

::: sidebar

Note that you can get the same effect by passing the name of the function as a string, rather than the function itself:

```{r}
sapply(1:5, "+", 3)
```

This works because because `sapply` can be given the name of a function instead of the function itself: if you read the source of `sapply()`, you'll see the first line uses `match.fun()` to find functions given their names. Functions in the purrr package don't do this, instead using character inputs as a shortcut for subsetting.

:::

### Modifying in place

If you need to modify part of an existing data frame, it's often better to use a for loop. For example, the following code performs a variable-by-variable transformation by matching the names of a list of functions to the names of variables in a data frame.

```{r}
trans <- list(
  disp = function(x) x * 0.0163871,
  am = function(x) factor(x, labels = c("auto", "manual"))
)
for(var in names(trans)) {
  mtcars[[var]] <- trans[[var]](mtcars[[var]])
}
```

We wouldn't normally use `lapply()` to replace this loop directly, but it is _possible_. Just replace the loop with `lapply()` by using `<<-`: \indexc{<<-}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lapply(names(trans), function(var) {
  mtcars[[var]] <<- trans[[var]](mtcars[[var]])
})
```

The for loop is gone, but the code is longer and much harder to understand. The reader needs to understand `<<-` and how `x[[y]] <<- z` works (it's not simple!). In short, we've taken a simple, easily understood for loop, and turned it into something few people will understand: not a good idea!

### Recursive relationships

It's hard to convert a for loop into a functional when the relationship between elements is not independent, or is defined recursively. For example, exponential smoothing works by taking a weighted average of the current and previous data points. The `exps()` function below implements exponential smoothing with a for loop. \index{recurrence relations}

```{r}
exps <- function(x, alpha) {
  s <- numeric(length(x) + 1)
  for (i in seq_along(s)) {
    if (i == 1) {
      s[i] <- x[i]
    } else {
      s[i] <- alpha * x[i] + (1 - alpha) * s[i - 1]
    }
  }
  s
}
x <- runif(6)
exps(x, 0.5)
```

We can't eliminate the for loop because none of the functionals we've seen allow the output at position `i` to depend on both the input and output at position `i - 1`.

One way to eliminate the for loop in this case is to [solve the recurrence relation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation#Solving) by removing the recursion and replacing it with explicit references. This requires a new set of mathematical tools, and is challenging, but it can pay off by producing a simpler function.

### While loops

Another type of looping construct in R is the `while` loop. It keeps running until some condition is met. `while` loops are more general than `for` loops: you can rewrite every for loop as a while loop, but you can't do the reverse.  For example, we could turn this for loop: \index{loops!while} \indexc{while}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (i in 1:10) print(i)
```

into this while loop:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
i <- 1
while(i <= 10) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
}
```

Not every while loop can be turned into a for loop because many while loops don't know in advance how many times they will be run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
i <- 0
while(TRUE) {
  if (runif(1) > 0.9) break
  i <- i + 1
}
```

This is a common problem when you're writing simulations.

In this case we can remove the loop by recognising a special feature of the problem. Here we're counting the number of failures before Bernoulli trial with p = 0.1 succeeds. This is a geometric random variable, so you could replace the code with `i <- rgeom(1, 0.1)`. Reformulating the problem in this way is hard to do in general, but you'll benefit greatly if you can do it for your problem.


### Exercises

1.  Why are the following two invocations of `lapply()` equivalent?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    trims <- c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5)
    x <- rcauchy(100)
    
    lapply(trims, function(trim) mean(x, trim = trim))
    lapply(trims, mean, x = x)
    ```

1.  The function below scales a vector so it falls in the range [0, 1]. How
    would you apply it to every column of a data frame? How would you apply it 
    to every numeric column in a data frame?

    ```{r}
    scale01 <- function(x) {
      rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
      (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
    }
    ```

1.  Use both for loops and `lapply()` to fit linear models to the
    `mtcars` using the formulas stored in this list:

    ```{r}
    formulas <- list(
      mpg ~ disp,
      mpg ~ I(1 / disp),
      mpg ~ disp + wt,
      mpg ~ I(1 / disp) + wt
    )
    ```

1.  Fit the model `mpg ~ disp` to each of the bootstrap replicates of `mtcars` 
    in the list below by using a for loop and `lapply()`. Can you do it 
    without an anonymous function?

    ```{r}
    bootstraps <- lapply(1:10, function(i) {
      rows <- sample(1:nrow(mtcars), rep = TRUE)
      mtcars[rows, ]
    })
    ```

1.  For each model in the previous two exercises, extract $R^2$ using the
    function below.

    ```{r}
    rsq <- function(mod) summary(mod)$r.squared
    ```


## Vector functionals {#functionals-fp}

Another way of thinking about functionals is as a set of general tools for altering, subsetting, and collapsing vectors. Every functional programming language has three tools for this: `Map()`, `Reduce()`, and `Filter()`. We've seen `Map()` already, and the following sections describe `Reduce()`, a powerful tool for extending two-argument functions, and `Filter()`, a member of an important class of functionals that work with predicates, functions that return a single `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

### Reduce

`Reduce()` reduces a vector, `x`, to a single value by recursively calling a function, `f`, two arguments at a time. It combines the first two elements with `f`, then combines the result of that call with the third element, and so on. Calling `Reduce(f, 1:3)` is equivalent to `f(f(1, 2), 3)`. Reduce is also known as fold, because it folds together adjacent elements in the list. \indexc{Reduce()} \index{fold}

The following two examples show what `Reduce` does with an infix and prefix function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Reduce(`+`, 1:3) # -> ((1 + 2) + 3)
Reduce(sum, 1:3) # -> sum(sum(1, 2), 3)
```

The essence of `Reduce()` can be described by a simple for loop:

```{r}
Reduce2 <- function(f, x) {
  out <- x[[1]]
  for(i in seq(2, length(x))) {
    out <- f(out, x[[i]])
  }
  out
}
```

The real `Reduce()` is more complicated because it includes arguments to control whether the values are reduced from the left or from the right (`right`), an optional initial value (`init`), and an option to output intermediate results (`accumulate`).

`Reduce()` is an elegant way of extending a function that works with two inputs into a function that can deal with any number of inputs. It's useful for implementing many types of recursive operations, like merges and intersections. (We'll see another use in the final case study.) Imagine you have a list of numeric vectors, and you want to find the values that occur in every element:

```{r}
l <- replicate(5, sample(1:10, 15, replace = T), simplify = FALSE)
str(l)
```

You could do that by intersecting each element in turn:

```{r}
intersect(intersect(intersect(intersect(l[[1]], l[[2]]),
  l[[3]]), l[[4]]), l[[5]])
```

That's hard to read. With `Reduce()`, the equivalent is:

```{r}
Reduce(intersect, l)
```

Map-reduce

### Predicate functionals
\index{predicates} 
\index{functions!predicate|see{predicates}}

A __predicate__ is a function that returns a single `TRUE` or `FALSE`, like `is.character`, `all`, or `is.NULL`. A predicate functional applies a predicate to each element of a list or data frame. There are three useful predicate functionals in base R: `Filter()`, `Find()`, and `Position()`. 

* `Filter()` selects only those elements which match the predicate.

* `Find()` returns the first element which matches the predicate (or the last 
  element if `right = TRUE`).

* `Position()` returns the position of the first element that matches the
  predicate (or the last element if `right = TRUE`).

The following example shows how you might use these functionals with a data frame:

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"))
detect(df, is.factor)
detect_index(df, is.factor)

str(keep(df, is.factor))
str(discard(df, is.factor))
```

### `map_if()` and `modify_if()`

Compare on data frame.

### Exercises

1.  Why isn't `is.na()` a predicate function? What base R function is closest
    to being a predicate version of `is.na()`?

1.  Use `Filter()` and `vapply()` to create a function that applies a summary 
    statistic to every numeric column in a data frame.

1.  What's the relationship between `which()` and `Position()`? What's
    the relationship between `where()` and `Filter()`?

1.  Implement `Any()`, a function that takes a list and a predicate function, 
    and returns `TRUE` if the predicate function returns `TRUE` for any of 
    the inputs. Implement `All()` similarly.

1.  Implement the `span()` function from Haskell: given a list `x` and a 
    predicate function `f`, `span` returns the location of the longest 
    sequential run of elements where the predicate is true. (Hint: you 
    might find `rle()` helpful.)

1.  Implement `arg_max()`. It should take a function and a vector of inputs, 
    and return the elements of the input where the function returns the highest 
    value. For example, `arg_max(-10:5, function(x) x ^ 2)` should return -10.
    `arg_max(-5:5, function(x) x ^ 2)` should return `c(-5, 5)`.
    Also implement the matching `arg_min()` function.

## Base functionals {#functionals-math}

Base R functionals have more of a mathematical/statistical flavour.

### Matrices and array operations

So far, all the functionals we've seen work with 1d input structures. The three functionals in this section provide useful tools for working with higher-dimensional data structures. `apply()` is a variant of `sapply()` that works with matrices and arrays. You can think of it as an operation that summarises a matrix or array by collapsing each row or column to a single number. It has four arguments: \indexc{apply()}

* `X`, the matrix or array to summarise
* `MARGIN`, an integer vector giving the dimensions to summarise over, 
  1 = rows, 2 = columns, etc.
* `FUN`, a summary function
* `...` other arguments passed on to `FUN`

A typical example of `apply()` looks like this

```{r}
a <- matrix(1:20, nrow = 5)
apply(a, 1, mean)
apply(a, 2, mean)
```

There are a few caveats to using `apply()`. It doesn't have a simplify argument, so you can never be completely sure what type of output you'll get. This  means that `apply()` is not safe to use inside a function unless you carefully check the inputs. `apply()` is also not idempotent in the sense that if the summary function is the identity operator, the output is not always the same as the input:

```{r}
a1 <- apply(a, 1, identity)
identical(a, a1)
identical(a, t(a1))
a2 <- apply(a, 2, identity)
identical(a, a2)
```

(You can put high-dimensional arrays back in the right order using `aperm()`, or use `plyr::aaply()`, which is idempotent.)

`sweep()` allows you to "sweep" out the values of a summary statistic. It is often used with `apply()` to standardise arrays. The following example scales the rows of a matrix so that all values lie between 0 and 1. \indexc{sweep()}

```{r}
x <- matrix(rnorm(20, 0, 10), nrow = 4)
x1 <- sweep(x, 1, apply(x, 1, min), `-`)
x2 <- sweep(x1, 1, apply(x1, 1, max), `/`)
```

The final matrix functional is `outer()`. It's a little different in that it takes multiple vector inputs and creates a matrix or array output where the input function is run over every combination of the inputs: \indexc{outer()}

```{r}
# Create a times table
outer(1:3, 1:10, "*")
```

### `tapply()`
\indexc{split()}

You can think about `tapply()` as a generalisation to `apply()` that allows for "ragged" arrays, arrays where each row can have a different number of columns. This is often needed when you're trying to summarise a data set. For example, imagine you've collected pulse rate data from a medical trial, and you want to compare the two groups: \indexc{tapply()}

```{r}
pulse <- round(rnorm(22, 70, 10 / 3)) + rep(c(0, 5), c(10, 12))
group <- rep(c("A", "B"), c(10, 12))

tapply(pulse, group, length)
tapply(pulse, group, mean)
```

`tapply()` works by creating a "ragged" data structure from a set of inputs, and then applying a function to the individual elements of that structure. The first task is actually what the `split()` function does. It takes two inputs and returns a list which groups elements together from the first vector according to elements, or categories, from the second vector:

```{r}
split(pulse, group)
```

Then `tapply()` is just the combination of `split()` and `sapply()`:

```{r}
tapply2 <- function(x, group, f, ..., simplify = TRUE) {
  pieces <- split(x, group)
  sapply(pieces, f, simplify = simplify)
}
tapply2(pulse, group, length)
tapply2(pulse, group, mean)
```

Being able to rewrite `tapply()` as a combination of `split()` and `sapply()` is a good indication that we've identified some useful building blocks. 

### Mathmatical

Functionals are very common in mathematics. The limit, the maximum, the roots (the set of points where `f(x) = 0`), and the definite integral are all functionals: given a function, they return a single number (or vector of numbers). At first glance, these functions don't seem to fit in with the theme of eliminating loops, but if you dig deeper you'll find out that they are all implemented using an algorithm that involves iteration.

In this section we'll use some of R's built-in mathematical functionals. There are three functionals that work with functions to return single numeric values: \indexc{integrate()} \indexc{uniroot()} \indexc{optimise()}

* `integrate()` finds the area under the curve defined by `f()`
* `uniroot()` finds where `f()` hits zero
* `optimise()` finds the location of lowest (or highest) value of `f()`

Let's explore how these are used with a simple function, `sin()`:

```{r}
integrate(sin, 0, pi)
str(uniroot(sin, pi * c(1 / 2, 3 / 2)))
str(optimise(sin, c(0, 2 * pi)))
str(optimise(sin, c(0, pi), maximum = TRUE))
```
